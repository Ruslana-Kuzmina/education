### The SQLite Database Environment

1.How to access the DB Browser for SQLite software

There are a few reasons for choosing DB Browser, but some of the main reasons are:

- SQLite is a free
- SQLite open source database management system, open to the public

DB Browser for SQLite is a visual tool that's used to create, design and edit database
files compatible with SQLite.

2.The query writing area

Let's take a look at the third important area that we should get familiar with in our
DB Browser for SQLite database software. 

Now, let's take a look at the Execute SQL tab. Now, let me point out some main components
that we should take a note of at the moment.

- query pane - I'm just typing in random words at the moment, but this is where we'll
be composing our queries
- result pane - we will have an area to observe the results of executing a query
- message pane "Execution finished without errors". If we compose a query, observe
the result, the messages pane tells us if that query has run without error. It tells us
how long that query took to run, and a lot of other vital information that's going to
be useful to us as SQL practitioners.
