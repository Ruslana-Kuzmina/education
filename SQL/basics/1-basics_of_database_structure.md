# The Basics of Database Structures

- Relational Database theory

Data is the plural of the word datum, and a datum is defined as a piece of information.
So data are pieces of information like your last social media post, whether that's text,
images, or video, or the last phrase you search for on Google. 

Second, a database. It's simply a collection of data. That data can be organized in many
different ways, but it's usually organized in tables. 

Now, what are tables? In the world of SQL, tables are made up of rows and columns. Rows
run left to right and columns up and down, think Excel spreadsheet. Each row represents
a single piece of data called a **record**. Each column represents a specific attribute
of that data, such as name or address. In order to get the data, take a look at it, and
analyze it, we use a special language called **SQL**, short for Structured Query Language.
SQL includes many different commands or keywords. One of the most common is SELECT. 

SELECT statement
- common SQL command
- specifies table columns

The software system that's used to compose SQL statements is called a **Relational**
**Database Management System or RDBMS** for short. 

So an RDBMS, though there are many different varieties, the singular function is to
allow us an area to compose SQL statements. 

The SELECT clause   |
The FROM clause     |    SQL Statement
The ORDER BY clause |

SELECT
    InvoiceData     |
    BillingAdress   |    Fields
    BillingSity     |
    Total           |

FROM
    invoices        |    Table

ORDER BY
    Total;

1.The Basics of Database Structures

- How does a table differ from other data organization methods?

    - [x] It is two-dimensional.
          The defining features of a table are the rows and columns.
    - [ ] It contains records.
    - [ ] It has headings.

2.The SQL Stack

- Which strategy should you use for learning SQL?

    - [ ] Examine a case study in detail.
    - [ ] Read everything you can find.
    - [ ] Create several different databases.
    - [x] Practice translating questions into structured queries.
          Going through the process of typing commands and perfecting syntax is very
          helpful.
