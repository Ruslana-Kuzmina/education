to develop a complete web application

It is harder than before for any business to win over competitors. And websites
are now essential for business success. Almost every day new web development trends
appear, so there is no shortage of work for any kind of developers.

Front-End Developer

Front-end devs make sure that visitors can easily interact with a website, they are
also responsible for the architecture of a website's immersive user experiences.
Front-end engineers collaborate with UX analysts and designers to develop wireframes.
In other words, if a back-end engineer builds a house, then a front-end dev has
the role of an interior designer. Sometimes front-end devs are more enthusiastic
about what they do, because they often implement their creativity.

Back-End Developer

The back end of a website is something that visitors do not see. It consists of
servers, databases, operating systems, APIs, etc. A back-end engineer creates the
technology that makes all those components work. But writing the code is not the only responsibility of back-end devs.

Before creating a website, they collaborate with investors to understand what they
actually need. Then back-end devs make a technical requirement document that defines
the purpose and functionalities of the website. They also provide the most effective
solution that regards architecting technology.

Full-Stack Developer

Full stack devs combine the characteristics of front and back end engineers. They can work 
cross-functionally both, on server and user sides, i.e. on the full "stack" of
technology. A lot of companies give priority to developers who can use the best
means to deal with user and server software.

different professionals responsible for particular modules.
