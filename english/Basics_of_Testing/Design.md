# UI and UX

UI design

The most important feature of any UI is its clarity. You have to generate something
that will be easily understandable and intuitive to use. You have to incorporate
clues to guide users which they can recognize and use to predict the results of
their actions, leading to their fulfillment. When interacting with UI elements,
clear and cohesive design becomes an important part of user retention as well.

When designing screens, keep in mind that each of them has to support a single
action, which makes it easier for users to recognize this purpose and learn how
to utilize it. Furthermore, you can build upon this foundation, expand it and
improve it much easier, too. You can, of course, implement more actions into a
screen, but people are much more likely to make a commitment to simpler elements.

Just as in the physical world, laws of physics may influence your decision-making
in UI design. For example, color can be perceived differently at different times
of day or under different conditions, which makes it a very poor choice to
differentiate UI elements. Use it to highlight something or string users along,
but never rely on it as the only way to determine which element does what exactly.

UX design

Users are at the core of the UX design, and designers should always focus on their
needs and wants — it is in the name after all. The end goal of the user-centric
approach is to make sure the interaction with your product is a pleasant experience
for your users.

Consistency is key in the design of products, and you have to keep this mind if you
want to create something that's easily marketable. We are hardwired to look for
similarities between the things we use on a regular basis. This makes the designers'
jobs easier, too, since they don't have to come up with all-new approaches for
every project, but the downside is, you have to follow the existing trends if you
want your product to be truly addictive to your user base.

Always focus on the context when designing a product — this is the pillar of UX
design. Are people using your product in the office, sitting at a desk? Or is it
for users who are constantly on the move? Is it work-related or leisure-focused?
How much time do users have on their hands? What devices are they using? All of
this and more is crucial to a good end result. If you can make your product elicit
specific emotions — good ones, hopefully — in your users and make sure this emotional
connection is apparent and consistent, you are on your way to making the user
experience more positive.

## The best tools for UI design

MockFlow is a software suite that simplifies a number of processes within any
design project, which includes a variety of powerful tools to be used at different
stages. Its centerpiece, WireframePro, can be a great way to test out ideas by
quickly creating wireframes or prototypes. This way, you can have a visual
representation of a new concept, making it easier to discuss and see what works well.

Sketch, on the other hand, allows you to create high-level mockups of interfaces.
This tool has already gained a lot of popularity in the community, thanks to the
Symbols feature. With it, you can design assets that can be used in various projects,
simplifying the process of creating interfaces and making the end result more
consistent. The prototypes can easily be exported into different software with the
help of different plug-ins for the most popular collaboration programs, like Craft
for InVision.

Proto.io is a powerful instrument that you can use throughout the design process,
starting out from a rough hand-drawn sketch to a fully working prototype. You can
even add custom animations and vectors to improve the fidelity of your prototypes.
If you prefer using tools you already know, there are plug-ins for Sketch and Photoshop available. But overall, Proto.io is a great way to streamline the design process
in its entirety. It even includes user testing that you can use to test run and
receive feedback on your designs. It has proven its effectiveness, and many brands
began incorporating it into their workflow.

As the name implies, ProtoPie is as easy as pie to use, yet still has the capabilities
to string together complicated interactions. More importantly, it allows you to
access smart device features from your prototype without the need to hard code
these interactions, meaning it can utilize the data from gyroscopes, sound sensors
and so on. This makes it a powerful tool for the right application.

Figma is probably the most well-known and widely used design tool in the industry,
and thus needs no introduction. With it, you can quickly create interface mockups
of varying complexity. If your team members need to work on specific features
simultaneously, Figma is arguably the most powerful tool for the job.

MockFlow to build basic layouts quickly
Figma to let different people to work on a project at the same time
Sketch to create hi-fi interfaces and prototypes
Proto.io to create detailed animations and custom vector animations too
ProtoPie to create quite complex interactions

The tool with the ability to control the sensors of smart devices in your prototype
is ProtoPie.
The tool  where you can design UI assets and elements for reuse is Sketch.
The tool which supports teams working on every phase of the design process is Figma.
The tool with the feature of user testing is Proto.io.
The tool for creating wireframes is MockFlow.

**Agile software development** is an approach to software development under which
requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing
and cross-functional teams, and their customers/end users. It advocates adaptive
planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual improvement as
well as encourages rapid and flexible response to change.

SCRAM

To begin with, a product owner makes a product backlog.
Then, there is a sprint planning.
After that, the team sets a timeframe to complete work.
Next, the Scrum Master makes sure the team is working on their tasks.
Along the way, they meet every day to check the progress.
At the end of the sprint, the work should be completed at the end of the particular
sprint.
The next steps are a sprint review and a feedback.
What happens next is the cycle repeats.
Finally, the project is over.

Design thinking

1.Empathize with your users.
2.Define your users' needs, their problems, and your insights.
3.Ideate by challenging assumptions and creating ideas for innovative solutions.
4.Choose the best ideas.
5.Prototype to start creating solutions.
6.Test solutions.

Empathy
The ability to listen to people, understand their feelings, needs and actions.

Focusing
We process information about people's lives and highlight the problem with which
we will work. The point of this step is to formulate a question to solve.

Idea generation
At this stage, we come up with basic ideas. If you want the stage to be successful,
exclude criticism, create a positive atmosphere and collect players from different
departments. Don't forget to record everything.

Idea selection
All ideas are cool until they are faced with the real world. We filter ideas to
select viable ones.

Prototyping
A simple prototype will tell more than you could imagine, help you find the right
solution and not lose money.

Testing
Getting feedback on prototypes. We show the user the solution and ask what they do
not like about it, and why. It can be disappointing but helps to save resources
and money.

Advantages of the Waterfall Model:

This is, perhaps, one of the easiest models to manage, since at its core, every
phase has certain deliverables, followed by a detailed review.
Waterfall is a great fit for smaller projects, when you can easily understand the 
requirements for the end product.
Overall shorter delivery time frame for various projects.
Thorough documentation throughout the development process.
Whenever team composition changes regularly, Waterfall allows for simple adaptability.
Simple management of multiple dependencies within a project.

Advantages of the Agile Model:

The client-focused nature of this process means that a stakeholder is involved in
the development at every stage.
Agile teams are well-structured and motivated to complete the development. Consequently,
they are more likely to deliver a better product by the end.
The Agile methodology assures that high quality is maintained throughout the
development.
At its core, the Agile development process relies on incremental improvements.
Everyone involved is always aware of the progress made, which can reduce associated
workflow risks.

Limitations of the Waterfall Model:

This model has reduced effectiveness when implemented in large-scale projects.
If the requirements are not clearly defined for a project from the start, this
method will deliver worse results.
Going back to make any amendments to the deliverables of the previous phases is
much more difficult.
Testing doesn't start until development is complete. Therefore, many bugs will
be discovered much later in the process, making them more problematic—and
expensive—to fix.

Limitations of the Agile Model:

Reduced effectiveness when implemented on smaller projects.
An expert has to set specific milestones for the process and make decisions all
throughout the development.
If the project has tight deadlines, this methodology will not be as productive.
The implementation costs are higher for the Agile methodology of development.
If the project manager is unclear on the outcome, the process can easily get derailed.

Waterfall approach is perfect for projects with clear requirements, where changes
aren't anticipated. On the contrary, Agile should be applied if requirements are
likely to change quite often.
The Waterfall is rigid and easily manageable.
Agile is flexible: you can make changes at any point.
When you use Agile, requirements can often change, but in Waterfall, they are set
only once.
In Agile Description of project, you can change details whenever you need during
the SDLC process, whereas it is not possible in Waterfall.
