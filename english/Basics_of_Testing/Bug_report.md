# Bug Report

How to complete a bug report:

ID/name

Short and straight to the point is generally best here. It is a good idea to start
with a name of the problematic element, followed by a brief summary of the core of
the problem. For example, "Wishlist — unable to remove items from my wishlist."

A description/summary

Just the name might not be enough. If that is your case, feel free to add a short
passage outlining the issue. Keep it simple, and be sure to choose your words
carefully as the summary you write might get used later to keep track of the issue
on your bug-tracking app.

Environment

Be sure to include the context of the operating system, browser and screen size
you use, as web applications may operate differently on different platforms, and
this information may be incredibly relevant to the team fixing the problem.

The URL

The people helping you with your issue would appreciate it if you save them the
valuable time finding the problem by providing the URL of the page with the issue.

Visual proof

If you can, take a screenshot or a video of the problem. It might provide context
or illustration to the written description of the problem, and assist the technical
team in understanding the root of the problem faster and easier.

Steps to reproduce

Keep in mind that other people may not be experiencing the bug you have found,
especially if they haven't taken the steps you have. Be sure to detail the actions
you took before experiencing problems, so that the developers can retrace your
steps and try to replicate your issue to learn how to solve it.

Expected vs. actual results

Don't just say that something doesn't work — explain what you wanted the application
to provide you with, and how the issue you've encountered is different from what
your expectations were.

Optional

If you want, you can add extra details to your report, such as the desired due date,
your name and contact, how big of a problem you consider the bug to be and what
priority you want it to be given.

Questions:

1.What is the problem?
2.What is the exact URL of the site?
3.Can you take a screenshot of the bug?
4.What browser are you using?
5.What operating system are you using?
6.What platform are you using?
7.What did you expect to happen?
8.What actually happened?
9.What steps did you take before the error occurred?
10.How urgent is the issue?
11.Is there any additional information you can provide?

Effective bug reporting

Rule 1. Use good tools.

Would it make sense to send bug reports to the technical team via email? Is it
okay to save them in the Zoom chat? While both email and Zoom have their advantages,
they are not intended to be more than communication tools, and not places to store
information for further use. To make bug reports effective, you need to store them
where they can be accessed by multiple people, categorized easily, and have a very
low chance of getting lost. By using the appropriate tools, you can keep track of
what needs to be fixed, and you can foresee some of the problems, and make sure
they get sorted out appropriately. Such tools as Jira, Basecamp, Trello, etc. can
come in handy.

Rule 2. Train your team.

Anybody who has bug-reporting on their responsibility list, like front-line customer
service staff, would benefit from knowing how to work with bug reports. For instance,
any staff who work with customers are likely to receive feedback about bugs and
errors, and it might be useful if they learn how to get to the root of the problem
on the spot.

Rule 3. More information is always better.

They say that information rules the world. When it comes to staff with no technical
insight or experience, the more information they manage to relay to the technical
team, the better chance there is of the problem getting fixed efficiently and
effectively. The key to it, though, is that all the data has to be relevant to the
problem, so it is necessary for the staff to learn how to ask the right questions,
ask enough questions and be sure to note down the answers.

Rule 4. Help the customer immediately.

Certain bugs may take hours and even days to catch. However, when it comes to
problems, they generally need to be fixed as soon as possible to maintain customer
satisfaction. Customers are generally unaware of the company's inner bug-fixing
processes. They don't know how much time is necessary for a fix to be created and
applied, so any delay between the issue report and the release of the fix feels
significant to them. The faster their problem gets resolved, the more satisfied
they are likely to be. It is a good idea for front-line staff to have several
basic, simple techniques at hand that can be used to fix some of the more common
problems - turning the device off and on again is a popular example that is always
worth a try. However, it is important to adequately assess the seriousness of the
issue. Quick fixes are useful, but only in situations where they have a chance of
successfully working.

Rule 5. Implement a solid process.

Even with the best tools available, and the best-trained team you can get, there
is no way to guarantee a completely bug-free experience. The key to success is
coming up with a working solution that can be applied repeatedly, should a problem
arise. Create a clear action plan, make sure everyone knows what to do, and the
bug-fixing process will go much more smoothly. Of course, don't forget to adjust
the algorithm, should new information come into play. When everyone is the same
age and moves in the same direction, the whole business operates like a well-oiled
mechanism, and bug fixing is no exception.
