Decision-making meetings

We all know this situation: there is a problem in a company and there is a need
to come up with a solution. If you want to make an important decision collectively,
you should first understand people's interests individually, then call the meeting
and let the group share and come up with the only possible solution.

Brainstorming meetings

People usually attend these meetings to generate ideas. Preparing for them is easy:
invite only those people who want to participate, ask the right question and welcome
all the ideas the participants will produce – even the most absurd ones – you never
know what will work!

Kick-off meetings

Starting every project with this meeting is now a common practice in many companies.
The purpose of kick-offs is to discuss the main idea of the project and its plan.
This way the team makes sure that everyone goes in the same direction.

Scrum meetings

For 15 minutes every morning team members have to report on 3 questions: what
results they have achieved, what problems they have faced and what they are planning
to do next. Meeting's over, what's now? No more meetings and you can be productive
till the end of the day!

One-on-one meetings

The best way to build a relationship is to spend time with the individual. So such
meetings are a great chance to build better relationships and produce better results.
They can be informal conversations to get more feedback from an employee or a meeting
with a fixed agenda to help the employee to make decisions quickly.

Weekly meetings

The staff meets every week to report the results of the previous week and to prioritize
the tasks for the week. Such meetings are highly recommended for new companies because
they help effectively correct problems that constantly arise until reaching a stable
"operational core".

A workshop

 a meeting of people to discuss and/or perform practical work in a subject or activity.

A hackathon

is a design sprint-like event in which computer programmers and others involved
in software development, including graphic designers, interface designers, project
managers, domain experts and others, collaborate intensively on software projects.

## Steps about meeting

To ask, or not to ask

Imagine that you are listening and taking notes at the meeting, when suddenly you
hear a sentence you don't quite understand. You feel lost, but the presenter won't
stop. Let's see how you can clarify what's been said and avoid looking stupid at
the same time.

A question at a time

If you want to get full detailed answers, ask short questions covering a single
point. When you need to know two different things, ask two separate questions.

Ask open questions

Open-ended questions will invite the respondent to talk so they serve better in
getting more information. Ask "What do you like best about this company?" instead
of "Do you like this company?"

Don't use weak words and phrases

Forming a question, don't say "sorry, a silly question here" or "just a quick
question". If you use these words, people may lose confidence in you as a professional.

1.I apologize for the interruption, but I have an important question.
2.I wonder if you could say that in a different way.
3.That's not really how I see it.
4.Look at it this way.
5.Let me complete my thoughts.

Useful strategies

Always record yourself speaking at a meeting in English. Later, when you have free
time listen to your speech and try to notice and correct the mistakes you made.

Learn some phrases that you can use if you need to interrupt someone. For example,
Can I jump in? or I'm sorry for the interruption, but … . These phrases will give
you time to plan what you're going to say. Besides, you'll sound polite.

Learn new words every day. Just think, if you learn 10 new words per day for a year,
you'll have learnt 3650 new words by the end of the year!

Actively try to involve your colleagues by asking their opinions.

Instead of simply presenting your opinions (e.g. I think … ), use questions (e.g.
What do you think? or How do you feel about this?).

Don't forget that practice makes perfect. The more you speak English in public,
the better you'll do it.

Learn some phrases for checking understanding (e.g. What do you mean by … ? or Could
you put it differently, please?) and make sure you use them. Although it may be
embarrassing to ask for clarification, it's much better than misunderstanding the
person.

Don't let other people interrupt you too easily. Hold the floor with phrases like
Let me complete my thoughts or I'll let you speak in a second.
