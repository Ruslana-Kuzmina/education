- Concluding

  Let's sum up what we agree on.
  Let's look at what we decided to do.

1.Our problem is that we have accumulated tech debt, and now it is 7%.
2.I propose to allocate the resources of our development team and start fixing
  the bugs asap.
3.Another reason is that bugs started affecting the software performance.
4.I can't quite agree with you on that. We receive a lot of customers complaints,
and we have to use the resources of QA, Tech Support, Customer Success teams to
deal with those problems. That's a waste of time and money.
5.I agree to tackle not more than 5 bugs from the backlog per month if you agree on
SLA (Service Level Agreement) for fixing new bugs that are coming in. This way we
will start improving the software performance.
6.Let's sum up what we agree on. So, to eliminate the tech debt, we will tackle 5
bugs from the backlog per month.

1.So the situation is as follows: our customer churn rate is increasing along with
their complaints.
2.I think the best way to deal with it is to debug our product, for this I need you
to ask you to stop allocating all our free resources to making new features.
3.One of the key reasons for this is that we started losing our reputation.
4.That's not exactly how I look at it. If we accumulate more tech debt, it will
affect our income in the long term.
5.What if we assign a responsible for labeling all bugs from very urgent to the
ones that do not affect the software performance much? This way we will make a
step forward to eliminating our tech debt.
6.Let's look at what we decided to do. First, we will set the task to label the
bugs we have. This way we will know from where to start managing the tech debt.

All right, today we are going to discuss the recent issues that our company is facing,
so our new QA team lead will get up-to-date on the latest news. Shall we start then?

The first thing I want to announce is that the company's tech debt is reaching 7%
while the industry standard as you all know is below 5%.

Then we have recently found out that there have been several cases of customers
leaving to competitors because their profiles on the platform were missing some
important data, and it was not restored fast enough.

Another issue that might affect the reputation of our company is that one of the
customers has written a long public post describing that they have not received
the software and service advertised. The customer who wrote the post happened
to be an influencer.

One more issue came out after we had held a meeting with a development team. They
reported that they constantly have to keep in mind bugs while writing new code
which often makes the new feature delivery time longer. The project manager referred
to 200 extra hours spent on this during the last half a year.

They also revealed that some of the bugs were impacting performance. So the company
has invested in the additional hosting infrastructure. I will come up with exact
numbers a bit later.

So now QA, Tech Support, Customer Success teams are spending resources on documenting
bugs, prioritizing the fixing and helping the clients to fix their problems.

And as you all know, top management has publicly committed to focusing on the
quality first approach.

**Technical debt** is the cost of additional work that should be done after the
release of a project.

Tech debt happens when the speed of development process is more important than its
quality.

To calculate technical debt you need to compare the amount of time it will take
to pay the debt (meaning to fix something) to the amount of the time it took to build
that system.

It is generally accepted that reasonable tech debt is less or equal to 5%.

An excess of technical debt might result in low quality code, impact the product
performance and even reduce company's efficiency.

Examples:

His new job title improved his reputation among his colleagues.
In order to eliminate the debt, the company needs to allocate all resources and 
reduce the cost of extra projects
Now all our resources are concentrated on improving the performance.
The company has to deal with customer complaints otherwise it will lose its reputation.
Since we increased the cost of our product, our customer churn rate is getting higher.
Our analysts have found out that the accumulated debt affected our performance radically.

Increase of **customer churn rate**

We need to concentrate the biggest part of our resources on bug fixing to **meet customer needs** by giving them a bug-free product. This way we will stop losing our clients.

A loss of reputation in media

In order to **improve the company's reputation** in the media, we can announce
a zero bug policy and demonstrate the results to the public once the goal is achieved.

Delay in features' delivery

We can **reduce time and cost** of new features if the developers don't have to 
keep in mind bugs while writing new code. Thus, we will reduce delays.

Impact on performance

Some bugs were **affecting performance**. In order to improve it, the company had
to spend money on additional hosting infrastructure, which **increased the overall cost**
of the product. I propose making zero bug policy our main aim for the following
several months.

Wasting labor resources

We need to **allocate resources** effectively in order to reduce bugs to a minimum
in a short period of time, and free QA, Tech Support, and Customer Success teams
to do other tasks besides dealing with **customers complaints**.

Public commitment

Since top management has publicly committed to focus on "quality first" approach,
we cannot **lose our reputation** by not fulfilling the promise.

Guess the phrases from the exercise above.

1.When a number of customers stops using your service or buying your product during
  a certain period of time, it is called customer churn rate.
2.When you give a customer something that they want, you meet customer needs.
3.When you spend less time and money, it means you reduce time and cost.
4.When you divide resources and distribute them in a different way, you allocate
  resources.
5.If some factors influence performance and change it, it means they affect performance.
6.If the opinion about a company is not good, it means that it has lost the reputation.

Persuading skills can be very helpful at work when you need to persuade your boss, or motivate your team, or even incept some ideas into your clients' heads. Here are 5 tips that are very helpful if you want things to be your way.

Plan ahead

First and foremost, you need to be prepared for an effective and fruitful negotiation.
Decide on your goal, and on how much of that goal you can let go of. Prepare to
summarize your situation, for instance "So, the situation is as follows …".

Think also of who the other side of negotiation is, as well as their own needs
and wants. What proposals would they agree to? You can use "I propose to …" to
prepare your offer. That way you can keep focus on how much you can expect from
the negotiation.

Listen & Acknowledge

Many people believe that the point of a negotiation is to get a win for them,
and ignore the other party. However, listening to your negotiation partner, and
asking them questions, is incredibly important.

In addition, make sure you understand what was said by repeating and summarizing
the main points. You can use phrases like "Let's look at what we decided to do",
for example.

Some deals just don't work

Negotiations don't always end with a win. Sometimes there is just too much you
need to give up. It's not pleasant, but it is normal. Sometimes you can pause and
come back after you've had some time to think, or after the situation has changed.

Don't be afraid to disagree with an offer that doesn't suit you. You can still be
polite and say "That's not exactly how I look at it." and explain your point of
view by stating your reasons. "One of the key reasons is that …", for instance.

Enjoy it

Negotiations can be tense, drawn out or tiring. Everyone will be grateful if you
learn how to make it enjoyable.

Remember win-win

The best negotiation outcome is the one where both sides come out with a win. It
is always important to find a compromise. You can use conditional structures, for
example "I agree to, ... if you agree to …", to help you look for solutions that
would benefit both you and your negotiation partner.
