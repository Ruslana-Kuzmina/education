# Automated Testing

Problems that can be solved by testing automatically:

- Time-consuming tasks

  Every time the application is modified, QA needs to make sure it operates as
  expected. Running the same test repeatedly can take up a lot of valuable time.
  In such cases, regression tests can help to save both the time and the effort
  of the developers, providing detailed new bug reports to work on.

- Repetitive tasks

  In addition to saving time, automated testing provides flexibility that comes
  useful in executing repetitive operations in a project, especially in cases where
  similar features are constantly being added to the applications.

- Human error

  Manual testing, unfortunately, can be subject to distraction, time-wasting or
  misjudgement. Testing automatically eliminates issues like these, since all of
  its aspects are pre-written and executed according to the script.

- Advanced GUI testing

  If you need to compare how an application would operate across different platforms,
  such as browsers or OS, automated GUI tests can help you identify those differences,
  as well as compare and record them for future references.

- Load and performance assessment

  When it comes to an extensive number of users, there is simply no human resource
  capacity for it, and automated tests are the only viable option to assess
  application performance across countless simulations.

Areas where manual testing is preferred:

- UI acceptance

  There is no viable alternative when it comes to aesthetics, as scripted tests
  are not designed to make judgements on colors or font sizes. Human testing comes
  in handy in evaluating the visual aspects of user interfaces, simply because it
  is much easier and faster for the human eye to detect that the color of the link
  is very hard to see due to the color of the web page background, for instance.

- The early development phase

  The starting stage of the product development is the time when the product is
  at its most unstable. Using automated tests might be illogical, as it is generally
  more effective to identify bottlenecks, which will later result in less time and
  resources being needed for bug-fixing.

- Smaller projects

  Automated tests are incredibly useful in big, time-consuming projects that have
  enough resources to create testing scripts and make sure they work well. Simply
  put, investing time in automating the tests, you save time running them. However,
  if the project does not require hundreds of tests, or is short-term, it might be
  more efficient to forego the whole automation process and stick to manual testing.

- Non-automatable cases

  In some cases, automated testing is simply not an option, like testing hardware,
  as it is nearly impossible to write algorithms to test sensors, touchpads or screens.
  This also concerns things that you can only check by hand, like the content of
  web images or the quality of the sound.
