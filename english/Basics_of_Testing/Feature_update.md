often without stopping to think.
If you **record** something, you keep information for the future, by writing it down or
storing it on the computer.
To **measure** something means to discover the exact size or amount of something.
If you **verify** something, you check or prove that something is correct or true.
To **toggle** means to switch a feature on a computer on and off by pressing the
same button or key.
**Sync** is an informal form of the verb synchronize, which means to connect two
electronic devices so that they both have the latest information or files.

Hello, everyone. I'm Maria Pierce, the product manager of the MeetingSpace app,
our software for all your company meeting needs. Today, let's dive into what is
new in MeetingSpace.

First up, an exciting preview feature. Imagine you need to record your meeting
in text format. Our new "Voice to text log" feature allows you to do that. Just
go to Options-Record-Voice to text, and the app will save everything you or your
colleagues say as a text file on your device.

Then, you can choose to record every speaker in a separate file, unless they have
issues with their microphones. You can also edit the text files later if necessary.

Since the last update, for video calls we've added the option to toggle your
background filter from the main menu. There is now a Filter icon at the bottom
left of the menu. You can enable, change and disable filters by simply opening
the Filter menu with that button.

Not only that, an experimental feature. You can now sync the meeting agenda for
all meeting participants, in case you need it. If you have a meeting agenda prepared,
its first point appears at the top of the app screen. You can set up a time limit
for each point as well. This feature might not work on older devices, so please
make sure that everyone has the sync option available.

All right, these are all the updates we have for you today. Did you like it? 
Please send your feedback at our email below. We will see you in a couple of weeks
with more exciting new features!

1.Our new software allows you to **capture** the video of your screen with only one click.
2.I'm sorry to say that the new version will not support the to-do list feature anymore.
3.If you don't want to pay extra, you can **opt out of** any features you don't need.
4.With this update, you can **apply** a variety of filters to your photos.
5.Please tell us what kind of **font** you would like us to add to the text app
  in the next update.
6.We always try to improve the quality of our website. Recently, we have changed
  some visual elements on the front page to make sure the site runs faster.

1.If the OS of the user has a dark theme, Chrome automatically **applies** similar
  theme to light-theme websites. With the new update, you can **opt out of** this
  feature.
2.Chrome 98 allows you to use a wider choice of **fonts** and colors to make different 
  visual elements of the website more attractive to the user.
3.Chrome developers are working on improving the ease of adding emoji to the text
  on the page.

  Region Capture feature.
5.Before you update Chrome to version 100, you need to check that your code 
  **supports** three-digit codes.

Feature vs Functionality

When it comes to software, it is important to make the right choice, as software
tends to cost a lot of money. Some people dive into the first product that meets
their checklist of features, but doing it that way may lead to a mistake. You have
to be sure that the features you're looking for are also functional.

What is the difference between features and functions? Features are a set of
"instruments" inside a software. Functionality is the way those features actually
work. In other words, features are what the software can do, and functions are how
the software does it. For instance, many apps provide an opportunity to create
to-do lists as one of their features, but the difference in functionality may be
in the way those lists look, the limit of points you can add, the opportunity to
add tags and deadlines to the items on the list, and so on.

There are several ways to measure a functionality of your software before you choose
to buy it:

Set your priorities
Create a list of all the requirements you have for the software you need and then
organize them in the order of their importance. Which features and functions will
make the biggest difference for you? Knowing that allows you to have a good idea
of what to look for first.

Do a test run
A lot of software companies offer a limited free trial before you have to pay for
the software. Use it to test the list of requirements you made earlier, just so
you can try out specific functions.

Measure learning time
Other people may be using your software as well, so make sure to test how long it
would take for you or your colleagues to learn how to use it. Keep in mind that
you will also have to teach any new member of your team how to use it as well.

Test efficiency
The purpose of getting new software is to make your job easier. How many steps do
you have to take to get the result you need? Is it faster or easier than what you
do now? If not, then the software is not doing the job it needs.
