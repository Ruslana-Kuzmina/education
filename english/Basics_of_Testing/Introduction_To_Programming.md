# Introduction To Programming

Program Development Steps:

1.Defining and Analyzing The Problem 
2.Designing The Algorithm 
3.Coding or Writing The Program 
4.Test Execution
5.Debugging 
6.Final Documentation 

Words:

a specification - a detailed description of how something should be done, made, etc.
to modify - to change something slightly, esp. to improve it or make it more acceptable
or less extreme
to implement - to start using a plan or system
test execution - carrying out a code in order to contrast the definite results
with the expectations
to solve - to find an answer to a problem
an output - the information, results, etc. produced by a computer
to execute - to do or perform something, especially in a planned way
a solution - an answer to a problem
a bug - a mistake or problem in a computer program
documentation - official or legal documents that are needed to prove something
compatibility — able to exist together harmoniously
robust — strong and healthy; vigorous
memory allocation — a process by which computer programs and services are assigned
with physical or virtual memory space
garbage collection — a form of automatic memory management

Problem identification and assessment

During this phase, we evaluate the problem and come up with possible solutions to
it. Studying a problem is an important step, as it can assist us in the decision
about the following:

- The information and data necessary for program development.
- The direction for the program design.
- Also, the most appropriate language for the program.
- The output we want to have and its form, etc.

Algorithm design

In this step, we create a detailed course of action to solve the problem with the
use of the specification we have outlined in the previous stage. This stage is vital
for program development. That means we create the solution in incremental statements.

Program coding

In this stage, we create or implement verified programming instructions for the
steps outlined in the previous phase, using a programming language. This step
establishes an actual program.

Test execution

The process of executing the application to check the logic of the code, and single
out errors or bugs is called test execution. This helps the programmer to make sure
that the program is viable and does not contain any code-breaking errors.

Debugging

Debugging is a process of recognizing, identifying and fixing the errors in a program
by executing the program over and over again.

Final Confirmation

When the program is completed, we put together its documentation. User receives
the end-version of the documentation which directs him towards the most efficient
ways of using the program. In addition, the documentation can permit other programmers 
to modify the code to their needs. Every step of the program development should
have supporting documentation.

The programming language

JavaScript

This programming language occupies a significant position in front-end development.
It is compatible with a wide range of browsers and possesses a flexible and highly
adaptable structure.

Python

This programming language is easy to learn and incredibly user-friendly, due to
its structure being close to that of the English Language. This is probably why
this language has become so popular and wide-spread.

Java

This programming language is 99% object-oriented. It uses pre-programmed memory
designation and garbage collection, which makes this language easier than C++.
It also doesn't contain any outwards information references.

C# (C- Sharp)

This programming language was developed by Microsoft in the early 2000s. A .NET
framework is essential for it to operate. This language is widely used in the
development of desktop programs, especially for the latest Windows operating systems.

Swift

This programming language was developed by Apple Inc in mid-2014, and is widely
used for the development of iOS or Mac OS apps. It isn't limited to a single purpose
and its code is accessible to the general public.

IT jardon

**Foobar** is a slang word used by IT specialists to talk about common cases or
short-term information that is to be erased. Metasyntactic variables is a more
specific, technical term for files, programs, or lines of code like this.

**Humanware** is an IT term for hardware or software that is constructed with user
competences and demands in mind. This often refers to the development of a specific
visual or physical interface for a predetermined set of users.

**Cloud computing** refers to using a network of Internet services and platforms,
or "clouds", to stockpile, store, control or handle various data.

**Skunkworks** is a term for state-of-the-art, typically confidential, development
projects in such fields as technology, business and aerospace engineering.

**Fear-driven development (FDD)** is an IT term that refers to problems with software
development where companies become too paranoid with the idea of making mistakes
and regulate the development processes in ways that harm them and lower their efficiency.
It can also refer to the situation when the company management intimidates the
development teams into being too cautious, which can also be detrimental to the process.

**Hope Driven Development** refers to skipping the testing stage before launching
production.

**Egosurfing** involves looking up one's name or the name of one's business on the
Internet using a search engine.
