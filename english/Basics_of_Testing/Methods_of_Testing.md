a bottleneck - a problem that delays progress
viable - able to work as intended or able to succeed
vulnerability - the quality of being vulnerable (= able to be easily hurt,
influenced, or attacked), or something that is vulnerable
to eliminate - to remove or take away someone or something

Exemples:

2.Automated tests are done to eliminate human error.
3.Two-factor authentication is an extra viable security level.
4.The software translates programs from the language a human can read and understand
into the language a computer can execute.
5.to concern hardware-related tests

Why is the testing necessary?

Even though some people think it is nonsense to run various tests before a product
is presented to the public, I take my job very seriously.

I can give you 4 reasons why testing is necessary.

- First, security. If a computer system gets hacked, the hackers can get to all
  kinds of data that is private and they may use this to their own use. They could
  steal money from your bank, since they have access to all your banking
  details. If we do not protect our product and test it to make sure it is safe
  against hackers, the customer will not want to buy our product.

- Second, customer satisfaction. This is why we do it all. And in order to make
  sure the customer is happy with the product we test our software over and over
  again, so that all the little design mistakes are filtered out. A happy customer
  is a buying customer and leads to profit for the company. You understand, testing
  is a key factor in designing a product where the client can be content with.

- Next, product quality. When we talk about software, the buyer will always choose
  the product with the best quality reviews. With testing it before it makes it to
  the market, we make sure our product is what the customer expects from us. This
  is how we build up our product and brand reputation.

- Last, but not least, cost-effectiveness. Honestly, we can never guarantee for
  100% that there will be no faults in the software, especially in the more difficult
  and complex programs. This is not because the developers are not precise enough,
  but the number of connections and interferences are enormous. So again, this is
  where testing comes in; to make sure that the design issues are detected as soon
  as possible. If a bug can be traced in the early stages of development, it costs
  much less to fix them than when the product is almost all ready.

Well, now you know why product testing is so important and not something to laugh
about. Without me, you wouldn't enjoy your computer as much as you do now. As I
said, I take my job seriously because it is an important one.

**Manual testing** - is carried out by QA Specialists, who make certain that programs
operate correctly under the conditions outlined in pre-made test cases.

**Automated testing** - needs pre-made scripts and tests in order to run without
human involvement. They determine how well the programs are performing by comparing
the actual results of the test with the results that were anticipated.

Types of testing:

Functional testing - What does the system do?
Non-functional testing - How well does the system work?
Structural testing - Are there any new bugs?
Change-related testing - How good is the structure of code?

Functional testing looks into the use of the software or application when
it is put to the test. The procedure makes sure that every function of a product
operates according to the specifications as required. The software that is checked
with this type of testing is based on real-life performance and doesn't look into
the source code of the software or application. This form of testing is done to
check the behavior and operation of the software system. It is important to perform
functional testing firstly to understand how the system really works. The testing
is done by giving proper input and comparing actual results with expected results.
It involves testing of APIs, database, user interface, and functionality of the product.

On to non-functional testing. It checks the non-functional sides of the product,
such as usability, reliability, and performance of the software. It focuses on all
the parts that have not been focused on in the functional testing. When a product
runs as the consumer expects and is useful and operable under any circumstances,
it is seen as a reliable product. Non-functional testing is looked at from the view
of customer experience. It is a crucial factor in making sure the client is satisfied.
As it's very hard and takes up a lot of time to do non-functional testing manually,
some special automated tools are used in this type of testing.
