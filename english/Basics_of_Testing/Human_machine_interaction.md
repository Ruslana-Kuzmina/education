UI design principles

**simplicity** — the quality of being easy to understand or do
**distracting** — preventing concentration; disturbing
**a habit** — something that you do often or regularly, sometimes without knowing
that you are doing it
**to convert** — to change into a different form
**to inspire** — to make someone have a particular strong feeling or reaction
**to solve** — to find an answer to a problem
**emphasis** — special importance or significance

When less is more

Quite often, you'll see websites being over-designed, distracting the end-users
from their intended purpose through an abundance of design elements. The more consistent
and clear the design is, the more effective it will be. Try to make the user journey
as intuitive as possible through simplicity and cohesion.

Nonintrusive innovation

Taking a road untravelled, an innovative approach is a surefire way to create something
truly impressive. The greatest trick, however, is to make certain that the design
elements come together in the most cohesive and non-intrusive manner possible. The
design shouldn't distract the user from the task at hand, but it has to be unforgettable
at the same time, like the ingenious Nike Swoosh.

Making design appealing to the target audience

The product you develop or the service you provide are all created with a specific
client in mind. With the help of research into their habits and wants, you can
create a visual representation of your brand that would be appealing to your
customers and clients. Because in the end, a high visitor count does not matter
if it doesn't help you promote your product.

Use design elements to guide your users

Whether it's a landing page or a complete website, they have to captivate your
users from the start. Everything in the visual representation should serve a singular
purpose: inspiring visitors to learn more about your company. As they explore
the website and products or services on offer, they have to be converted into
customers by the end of the journey.

Focus on the core value proposition

You have to be clear in your visual communication. In as few words as possible,
you have to present a problem and show the visitors that your company provides the
way to solve it. The emphasis has to be on the needs and values of your customers.

UI design and business

**worthless** - not important or not useful
**placement** - the act of finding the right place for something
**content** - the information presented on a website or in other digital media
**taste** - a person's approval of and liking for particular things
**essential** - necessary or needed
**usage** - the process of using something

Why should you think about the UI as a business opportunity?

Presentation is crucial

A poorly thought-out or implemented product interface could mean your users leave
within mere moments with a bad taste. That is why companies invest a lot of time
and effort into developing an innovative and intuitive UI design that will add to
their value proposition.

Good design can drive numbers up

Great design elicits a positive response from the users. As a result, the usage of
design elements like the choice of colours, layout and placement of elements, fonts
and typography, etc., can create an additional communication channel with your
users and potential customers.

Content is the most powerful marketing tool — the right content

Clear and effective communication is an all-important aspect of the brand image
that eventually leads to positive changes in the annual report. Stable and
responsive UI serves as the perfect backdrop to your communication.

A place for everything and everything in its place

Intuitive and coherent navigation is an essential aspect of a good, functional UI.
No user will want to spend hours navigating the maze of an overly complex interface
to find what they are looking for, which would result in a potential loss of profit.

In the end, functionality is key

When it comes down to it, even the most streamlined UI is worthless if it's not
supported by the functionality of your software or website. An outstanding customer
experience hinges on how well your product actually functions.

Successful UI design

Tilt Brush

Creating a good VR app is very challenging as you can easily get motion sick after
several hours of using it. See, what works for flat screens doesn't translate quite
as well into virtual reality, and the same tools won't be as effective.

That's why Google's Tilt Brush — the software that lets you create 3D paintings
in a virtual environment — is so impressive. It is easy to use and lets you achieve
fantastic results. This means that more and more artists began to incorporate this
software into their creative workflows.

MailChimp
Writing up newsletters is far from being the most exciting job in the world, but
dedicated software can make it much more bearable. With its intuitive UI, MailChimp
provides you with the tools necessary to succeed. After you set up your account,
you're assisted by visual prompts and clues that help you overcome the fear of the
blank page. New users are also guided by clear calls to action at every step of
the way — something as basic as an animated pointer to tell you where to click
can make a big difference.

Paper for iPad
This award-winning app is designed to help users unleash their creativity in the
most intuitive way possible. You can use a stylus to create stunning works of art
on your iPad, but even when drawing with your fingers, Paper allows for an amazing
level of detail.

There are no buttons or settings for you to worry about, and everything can easily
be achieved with a few taps on the screen. This app is an excellent example of the
simplistic UI that Apple products are so well-known for. Paper comes with a standard
Draw tool that resembles a fountain pen, and other tools are available for purchase
within the app.

Tilt brush:

- doesn't cause motion sickness;
- is very intuitive;
- is liked by many artists;

MailChimp:

- makes the process of writing a letter more interesting;
- has an intuitive interface;
- has user guides which look very nice;

Paper for iPad:

- lets you draw with your fingers;
- is designed for touch;
- lets you draw with a fountain pen-style Draw tool for free;
- suggests other Draw tools for an additional cost.

Mistakes in UI design

1.Information overload

Have you ever tried choosing lunch at a buffet? We are used to thinking that more
variety is always better, but the truth of the matter is that our brains can only
process so much data before we get overwhelmed. If there is too much choice or too
much information, it actually harms our decision-making process. When it comes to
apps, users have simple, specific needs, but in their desire to get more customers,
many developers implement thousands of options and hundreds of buttons in their
software. And the instructions on how to use all those functions take up pages and
pages of text, which creates a lot of confusion for the user.

How would you solve this issue?

Suggestion

If something is overly complex, simplify it whenever possible. As was mentioned
before, users typically have very specific needs for their software. Understanding
those needs can help reduce information overload and create solutions that fit
particular purposes instead of trying to do everything at the same time. If you
have to give instructions, try to put them into a visual form that would be quick
and easy to understand.

2.Mystery meat navigation

The opposite problem occurs when the user has too little information to make a
decision. Have you ever seen a website that only has pictures? No labels, no "click
here to …", no other indicator of what can be done at all. Of course, you can
always try clicking somewhere to see what happens, but the years of using the
Internet have taught many people to be extra careful. We don't want to accidentally
buy something or break our devices by clicking an unmarked link. How would you
improve such a situation?

Suggestion

The solution here is simple — always label your links. If your users have to press
a button, they need to know what pressing the button does. If you want them to
follow a link, you need to inform them where the link goes.

3.Adding friction to user actions

Time is a valuable resource in the modern world. Your users want to achieve their
goals as quickly and easily as possible. So how would they feel if every time they
take an action, a window appears saying "Are you sure you want to do this?", and
they have to click the confirmation button? Every. Single. Time.

Of course, you don't want your users to accidentally do something they will regret.
So how can this situation be balanced?

Suggestion

It is generally better to avoid adding friction to user actions if the consequences
aren't serious. Of course, you need to ask for confirmation if someone, say, wants
to delete a lot of data. But actions like changing a page or loading search options
should only take one short action from the user.

4."Clever" design that ignores usability

The design of the project is very important. You want it to be memorable, catchy
and clever. The problem is, sometimes the design can be too clever, to the point
where it harms the usability of the product. For instance, the elements of UI may
be arranged in a beautiful and creative pattern but make it hard for users to find
what they are looking for. How can this issue be avoided?

Suggestion

Truly clever design should always try to be as intuitive as possible. Remember that
users are not designers — they do not have the background knowledge to help them
navigate the UI. It is best to test the design out on actual users to see how
usable it actually is.

5.Needless animation

Animation is another element of UI design. However, like all the other elements,
it has to have a purpose. Generally, animations take time to play out, which can
be the time the user doesn't have. Sure, they can look pretty, but it shouldn't
take 5 seconds to see items fly into your shopping cart in an online store, for
example. How can you use animation in a smarter way?

Suggestion

If an animation isn't necessary, it should either be skippable or not exist at
all. Good animations also run fast, creating the feeling of progress, rather than
just filling up the time. Overall, think each animation through before you implement
it into your project.

The 4 golden rules of UI design

The user interface is the most essential part of any software. It's barely noticeable
when done well but glaring and obtrusive when done poorly. Here are four rules
we think are the most important to a successful UI design.

1.Users should always be in control. By setting up visual cues you can create an 
easy-to-navigate interface, allowing users to explore freely and reach their
destination easily. Another important aspect is how predictable your interface is.
Providing users with a visible workflow that reflects where they are will assist
them and motivate them during a specific scenario.

2.Errors are very common on the user journey, but the way you present them can influence
the way users interact with your product. The less clutter and useless information
you put on the screen, the more comfortable their journey becomes. A good error
message is more likely to become a moment of conversion rather than discouragement.

3.Following the idea in the previous rule, you have to minimize information overload.
Visual clarity should be the priority when designing an interface. By organising design
elements in an easy-to-read manner, you improve the usability of your interface,
thus making your product more efficient and allowing users to find what they're
looking for quickly.

4.Make the interface of your product consistent because consistency promotes 
intuitive usage. By allowing users to learn the way certain elements interact and
then transfer this new knowledge to another part of the UI or to a different app,
you simplify the user journey in the future.

Situation:
This is the application that allows you to order different kinds of service for
your home. So what's wrong with it?

B: I believe that the design of the interface is simple and clean. But I see a
   problem here.
A: What is this problem?
B: First of all, the service description is missing here.
A: I see. Is it the only problem?
B: No. I would also like to add that the headline should be shifted a bit.
A: Why so?
B: Do you see that there is no space between the headline of application and the
   name of the service?
A: Oh, yes. Now I see it.

A: Do you know how to solve these problems?

B: First of all, we need to replace the word "order" with the type of service.
   Secondly, it is a good idea to add a short description of the service and what
   a worker is going to do.
   Moreover, we can add a short hint for a customer so that they know if they
   choose the right service.
   In the end, a search box can be added to the top.
