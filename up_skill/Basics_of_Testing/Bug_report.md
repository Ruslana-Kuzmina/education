How to complete a bug report:

ID/name

Short and straight to the point is generally best here. It is a good idea to start
with a name of the problematic element, followed by a brief summary of the core of
the problem. For example, "Wishlist — unable to remove items from my wishlist."

A description/summary

Just the name might not be enough. If that is your case, feel free to add a short
passage outlining the issue. Keep it simple, and be sure to choose your words
carefully as the summary you write might get used later to keep track of the issue
on your bug-tracking app.

Environment

Be sure to include the context of the operating system, browser and screen size
you use, as web applications may operate differently on different platforms, and
this information may be incredibly relevant to the team fixing the problem.

The URL

The people helping you with your issue would appreciate it if you save them the
valuable time finding the problem by providing the URL of the page with the issue.

Visual proof

If you can, take a screenshot or a video of the problem. It might provide context
or illustration to the written description of the problem, and assist the technical
team in understanding the root of the problem faster and easier.

Steps to reproduce

Keep in mind that other people may not be experiencing the bug you have found,
especially if they haven't taken the steps you have. Be sure to detail the actions
you took before experiencing problems, so that the developers can retrace your
steps and try to replicate your issue to learn how to solve it.

Expected vs. actual results

Don't just say that something doesn't work — explain what you wanted the application
to provide you with, and how the issue you've encountered is different from what
your expectations were.

Optional

If you want, you can add extra details to your report, such as the desired due date,
your name and contact, how big of a problem you consider the bug to be and what
priority you want it to be given.
