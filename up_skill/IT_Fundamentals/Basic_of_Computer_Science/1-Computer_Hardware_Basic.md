## Computer Hardware Basics

### Desktop Computer Components

#### System unit
- Front Panel:
	* Power buttons
	* Reset buttons
	* Audio out in 3,5 jack 
	* Mic in 3,5 jack
	* USB 2x and/or 3x ports.
- Back Panel:
	* Power supply=electricity
	* Audio ports
	* A monitor output
	* A mouse
	* A keyboard ins
	* A network connector
	* Several USB ports
	* Connectors for other types of monitors (for example, HDMI), etc.

#### Motherboard
It is a microlite printed circuit board, on which various microcircuits and expansion slots are soldered. It consists of:
- A CPU socket into which a processor is inserted like a plug
- DIMM Memory slots for installing RAM
- A SATA connector for connecting a hard disk drive (HDD) and a solid state drive (SSD). A **hard disk drive** and a **solid state drive** ensure long-term storage of information.
- A northbridge, PCI slots, a CMOS battery, BIOS
- A built-in sound card, a network card, a graphic card, USB ports

#### RAM
Stores the information about the commands that are executed, about programs, and about everything that is being worked with. It is not suitable for long-term storage, because the information disappears after a computer is turned off.
Types:
- DIMM (dual in-line memory module)
- SO-DIMM (small outline DIMM)
- DDR SDRAM (versions 2, 3, 4).

#### Power supply
is needed to make a constant flow of current from alternating current and to provide power to all components of a computer. A power supply consists of:
- **Voltage converters** is a sticker with data on a power supply. For example: input 220V, output + 3.3V, + 5V, + 12V
- **Power supply outputs** (e.g. for a motherboard, a processor, SATA power for SSD/HDD and PCIe power for a graphic card)

### Laptop Computer Components
- A motherboard
- CPU
- A cooling fan
- A RAM module
- An HDD or a SSD
- WWi-fi, Bluetooth module
- A battery
- Slots and sockets
