## Information Search

A typical way to search for information is to use search engines like Google,
Yahoo!, or Bing. The most popular one is Google; the name itself even became a
transitive verb. To google something means to search something using Google search
engine.

While it is very simple to use Google, there are several things which could help
you to get a better result:

- search on a specific site
- search for a specific file type
- exact match
- exclude words
- or operator
