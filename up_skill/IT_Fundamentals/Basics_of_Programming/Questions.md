# Introduction to Programming

- Each computer has a built-in instruction set and it knows how to execute it by
  design.
  - [x] True
  - [ ] False

- A computer executes instructions using its own intelligence.
  - [x] True
  - [ ] False

- Read the question below and select all correct answers. Then, click "Submit."

  - [x] A programming language is a set of rules that provides a way of telling
        a computer what operations to perform.
  - [ ] English is the main tool for developing executable models for a class
        of problem domains.
  - [x] A programming language provides a linguistic framework for describing
        computations.

- Computers help humans solve problems by automatically executing a sequence of
  instructions given to them and storing their results.
  - [x] True
  - [ ] False

- A(n) ___________ is a set of instructions, written by a coder, that enable computers
  to become useful.

  - [ ] Algorithm
  - [x] Computer program
  - [ ] System

- Which of the following is an interpreted programming language?
  - [x] Perl
  - [x] JavaScript
  - [ ] C++
  - [ ] Fortran
  - [ ] Pascal

## Data Types

- What will be displayed on your screen after running the following code?

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf( "Hello my dear friend!" )
    return 0;
}
```

- [ ] Hello my dear friend!
- [x] nothing since the code contains a syntax error
- [ ] "Hello my dear friend!"
- [ ] Hello my dear friend! Hello my dear friend!
- [ ] nothing since the code contains an algorithm error

Because he text (code) of the function is written in `{}`, i.e. a set of instructions
it executes, each of which ends with a ;

- How do you insert COMMENTS in Java code?
  - [ ] # This is a comment.
  - [x] // This is a comment.
  - [ ] /* This is a comment.

- In C, the size of an int variable and a long int variable is the same.
  - [x] True
  - [ ] False

- What will be displayed on your screen after running the following Java code?

```Java
class Main {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
         int a;
         System.out.println(a);
    }
}
```

- [ ] 0
- [x] nothing since the code contains a compile error
- [ ] 4
- [ ] nothing since the code contains a syntax error

- ________ is treated as a real number by default.

  - [ ] Float
  - [x] Double
  - [ ] Long
  - [ ] Long double

- Which of the following is a valid declaration in C?
  - [x] short int a;
  - [x] short a;
  - [x] unsigned short a;
  - [x] unsigned short int x;
  - [ ] unsigned short int int a;

- Which of the following is NOT a legal variable name in C?
  - [ ] int var_1;
  - [ ] int firstVar;
  - [ ] int first_var;
  - [x] int first-var;
  - [x] int 1var;

- How do you create a variable var with the numeric value 10 in C?
  - [ ] var = 10
  - [ ] char var = 10;
  - [x] int var = 10;
  - [x] int var=10;

### Operators, Expressions

- Choose the correct examples of variable assignment.
  - [x] x = 5
  - [ ] 5 = x + y
  - [ ] 5*2 = i
  - [x] x = 5*2
  - [x] x = y = z = 0
  - [x] x=x+4
  - [ ] x+1=y+2
  - [ ] x+4=x;

In the beginning we need to put function like x or y.

- What will be displayed as a result if an expression is (double)(5/3+6+8)?

  - [ ] 15
  - [ ] 15.667
  - [x] 15.00

We put this function in Java System.out.println((double)(5/3+6+8))

- Enter the correct operator to multiply 7 by 3, and print the result in Python:
  print(7__3). Be sure to enter only the operator into the field below.

  - [x] *

- Use the correct comparison operator to check if 7 is not equal to 3 in Python:
  if 7__3: print("7 and 3 is not equal"). Be sure to enter only the operator into
  the field below.

  - [x] !=

- __________ is used to compare the values of two operands.

  - [x] A relational operator

- What will be displayed on your screen after running the following C code?

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int a = (4, 6, 8);
    printf("%d", a);
    return 0;
}
```

- [ ] 0
- [x] 8
- [ ] 4
- [ ] 6
- [ ] Compile time error

When using the assignment operator, the expression is evaluated from left to right.
And since the parenthesis operator has a higher precedence than the assignment
operator, because of the program execution, the last number from the parentheses
will be displayed, in this case, 8.

- Which one or more of the following operators are logical in C ?

  - [x] !
  - [ ] ^
  - [ ] &
  - [x] &&
  - [ ] |

- Which operator is used to get the remainder after the division?

  - [ ] //
  - [x] %
  - [ ] /
  - [ ] ^
  - [ ] *

- What is the answer if the following expression in C is evaluated?

`10 + 33 % 5 * 7 / 3 % 4 + 3`

- [ ] 16

## Basic Statement of Programming

- ________ statements allow programs to take into account the conditions and execute
  specific program instructions based on the taken decision.

  - [x] selection
  - [ ] iteraction

- In C or Java, in order to stop the loop if i is 6, you use:

```C
for(int i = 2; i < 12;i++){
    if(i == 6){
        _______;
    }
}
```

- [ ] case
- [x] break 
- [ ] goto
- [ ] continue
- [ ] stop

## Algorithm Design and Modern Software Process Models

- An iterative process of system development in which requirements are converted
  to a working system that is continually revised through risk analysis is
  called _______.

  - [ ] Waterfall Modeling
  - [ ] Kanban Modelling
  - [x] Spiral Modelling
  - [ ] Iterative Modelling

- What does the symbol below represent in a flowchart of a program in computer
  programming? rectangle

  - [ ] Decision
  - [ ] Start or end
  - [ ] Flow line
  - [x] Process
