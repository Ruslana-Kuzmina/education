# Introduction to Programming

- Each computer has a built-in instruction set and it knows how to execute it by
  design.
  - [x] True
  - [ ] False

- A computer executes instructions using its own intelligence.
  - [x] True
  - [ ] False

- Read the question below and select all correct answers. Then, click "Submit."

  - [x] A programming language is a set of rules that provides a way of telling
        a computer what operations to perform.
  - [ ] English is the main tool for developing executable models for a class
        of problem domains.
  - [x] A programming language provides a linguistic framework for describing
        computations.

- Computers help humans solve problems by automatically executing a sequence of
  instructions given to them and storing their results.
  - [x] True
  - [ ] False

- A(n) ___________ is a set of instructions, written by a coder, that enable computers
  to become useful.

  - [ ] Algorithm
  - [x] Computer program
  - [ ] System

- Which of the following is an interpreted programming language?
  - [x] Perl
  - [x] JavaScript
  - [ ] C++
  - [ ] Fortran
  - [ ] Pascal

## Data Types

- What will be displayed on your screen after running the following code?

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    printf( "Hello my dear friend!" )
    return 0;
}
```

- [ ] Hello my dear friend!
- [x] nothing since the code contains a syntax error
- [ ] "Hello my dear friend!"
- [ ] Hello my dear friend! Hello my dear friend!
- [ ] nothing since the code contains an algorithm error

Because he text (code) of the function is written in `{}`, i.e. a set of instructions
it executes, each of which ends with a ;

- How do you insert COMMENTS in Java code?
  - [ ] # This is a comment.
  - [x] // This is a comment.
  - [ ] /* This is a comment.

- In C, the size of an int variable and a long int variable is the same.
  - [x] True
  - [ ] False

- What will be displayed on your screen after running the following Java code?

```Java
class Main {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
         int a;
         System.out.println(a);
    }
}
```

- [ ] 0
- [x] nothing since the code contains a compile error
- [ ] 4
- [ ] nothing since the code contains a syntax error

- ________ is treated as a real number by default.

  - [ ] Float
  - [x] Double
  - [ ] Long
  - [ ] Long double

- Which of the following is a valid declaration in C?
  - [x] short int a;
  - [x] short a;
  - [x] unsigned short a;
  - [x] unsigned short int x;
  - [ ] unsigned short int int a;

- Which of the following is NOT a legal variable name in C?
  - [ ] int var_1;
  - [ ] int firstVar;
  - [ ] int first_var;
  - [x] int first-var;
  - [x] int 1var;

- How do you create a variable var with the numeric value 10 in C?
  - [ ] var = 10
  - [ ] char var = 10;
  - [x] int var = 10;
  - [x] int var=10;

### Operators, Expressions

- Choose the correct examples of variable assignment.
  - [x] x = 5
  - [ ] 5 = x + y
  - [ ] 5*2 = i
  - [x] x = 5*2
  - [x] x = y = z = 0
  - [x] x=x+4
  - [ ] x+1=y+2
  - [ ] x+4=x;

In the beginning we need to put function like x or y.
