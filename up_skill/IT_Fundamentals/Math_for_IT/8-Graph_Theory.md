# Graph Theory

## Definitions

A **graph** G is an ordered pair of sets (V,E)

G=(V,E)

where V is a non-empty finite **vertex set**, and E is a set of two-element subsets
of V, or an **edge set**. The elements of V are the **vertices** of the graph G.
The elements of E are the **edges** of the graph.

In terms of sets, the graph on Figure 1 is represented as follows:

V={v1,v2,v3,v4}
E={{v1,v2},{v2,v3},{v2,v4}}
G={{v1,v2,v3,v4},{v1,v2},{v2,v3},{v2,v4}}
