## Definition of a Function. Determining Whether a Relationship is a Function

A **relation** is a set of ordered pairs.

The **domain** of a relation is the set of the first components of each ordered
pair.

The **range** of a relation is the set of the second components of each ordered
pair.

The following set of ordered pairs is an example of a relation.

{(4,2),(9,3),(16,4),(25,5),(36,6),(49,7)}

The first number in each ordered pair is a perfect square integer. The second number
in each ordered pair is a square root of the first one.

{2,3,4,5,6,7} - range
{4,9,16,25,36,49} - domain

Each value in the domain is also known as an **input** value, or an **independent**
**variable**, and is often labeled with the lowercase letter x. Each value in the
range is also known as an **output** value, or a **dependent variable**, and is
often labeled with the lowercase letter y.

A **function** is a relation that assigns each input value to exactly one output
value. We say "the output is a function of the input."

All functions are relations, but not all relations are functions.

The **input** values make up the domain, and the **output** values make up the range.

{(-2,4),(-1,1),(0,0),(1,1),(2,4)}

This relation matches five integers to their squared values. Each input value,
{-2,-1,0,1,2} matches exactly one output value, {4,1,0}. However, two of the three
output values match two distinct input values.

Despite this fact, this relation is still a function. The deal is that for a relation
to be a function, each input must correspond to exactly one output. In the opposite
direction, such a correspondence is not required. In other words, no x-coordinates
should be repeated while y-coordinates can be repeated.

- Relation is a Function
  This relation is a function because each input corresponds to exactly one output.
  x1 -> y1
  x2 -> y2
  x3 -> y3

- Relation is a Function
  This relation is a function because each input corresponds to exactly one output.
  Note that both x2 and x3 correspond to y2 but this does not violate the definition
  of a function.
  x1 -> y1
  x2 -> y2
  x3 -> y2

- Relation is NOT a Function
  This relation is not a function. Note that one of the two inputs x2, corresponds
  to two outputs, y2 and y3. This is prohibited for functions.
  x1 -> y1
  x2 -> y2
  x2 -> y3

Functions with a one-to-one correspondence of outputs to inputs represent a special
kind of functions. A function is said to be a **one-to-one function** if each output
value corresponds to exactly one input value.

## Function Notation

The notation *y = f(x)* defines a function named f. This is read as "y is a function
of x." The letter *x* corresponds to the input value, or an independent variable.
The letter *y*, or f(x), corresponds to the output value, or a dependent variable.

For better understanding, we can think about a function f as a process or a rule
which if applied to the input x results in the output value y or f(x).

y = F(x) - Outputs, Range,

x - Inputs, Domain

### Graphical Representation of a Function

The last thing we should consider here are two tests. The first one, the *vertical*
*line* test, is a visual way to determine whether a curve is a graph of a function
or not. The second one is the *horizontal line* test which allows us to determine
whether a function is one-to-one.

A Vertical Line Test

A curve in the coordinate plane is a graph of a function if and only if no vertical
line intersects the curve more than once.

If a graph is a set of a few points, then a set is a function if and only if no
two points lie on the same vertical line.

A Horizontal Line Test

A function is one-to-one if and only if no horizontal line intersects its graph
more than once.

If a graph of a function is a set of a few points, then a function is one-to-one
if and only if no two points lie on the same horizontal line.

## Evaluating and Solving Functions

**Function evaluation** is the process of determining the output value corresponding
to the given input value.

**Function solving** is the process of determining the input values that produce
the given output value.

Because for a function each input value corresponds to exactly one output value,
evaluating will always result in one solution. Solving, in turn, can result in
more than one solution because different input values can produce the same output
value.

### Functions in Algebraic Form

We can formulate the following general approach to evaluate a function in formula
form:

- Replace the input variable in the formula with the provided value.

- Calculate the result

Exemples:

The function g(x) = - x^2 - 2x + 3 is given. Evaluate g(-2) and g(c+1)

Solution:

To evaluate g(x) = - x^2 - 2x + 3 at -2 and c + 1, we need to replace the input
variable x with -2 and c+1, respectively.

For g(-2), obtain the following:
g(-2) = - (-2)^2 - 2 (-2) + 3
      = - 4 + 4 + 3
      = 3

Similarly, for g(c+1):
g(c+1) = - (c+1)^2 - 2 (c+1) + 3
       = - (c^2 + 2c +1) - 2c - 2 + 3
       = - c^2 - 2c - 1 - 2c -2 + 3
       = - c^2 - 4c

To solve a function in formula form, perform the following steps:

- Set the provided output value equal to the function’s formula.

- Solve for the input variable.

Examples:

The function g(x) = - x^2 - 2x + 3 is given. Solve g(x) = 3 .

Solution:

g(x) = 3
-x^2 - 2x +3 = 3 // Replace g(x) with the formula
-x^2 - 2x = 0 // Subtract 3 from each side
-x(x+2) = 0 // Factor
x(x+2) = 0 // Multiply both sides by -1

If x(x+2) = 0, either x = 0 or x+2 = 0 (or both of them equal 0). We will set
each factor equal to 0 and solve for x in each case.

x = 0
x + 2 = 0 -> x = -2

Therefore, the output g(x) = 3  when the input is either x = 0 or x = -2.

#### Functions in Equation Form

To write a function given in equation form in algebraic form, perform the following
steps:

- Identify which variable is the input variable and which one is the output variable.

- Solve the equation to isolate the output variable to the one side of the equal
  sign, with the other side being an

To solve equations, use all the usual algebraic methods, such as adding or subtracting
the same quantity to or from both sides, or multiplying or dividing both sides of
the equation by the same quantity.

It is important to note that not every relationship expressed by an equation can
also be expressed as a function with a formula.

##### Functions in Tabular Form

Functions can be represented as tables. In this case, the table rows or columns
display the corresponding input and output values. When a function is given in
such a way, we can also evaluate and solve the function using a table.

To evaluate a function in tabular form, perform the following steps:

- Find the given input in the row (or the column) of input values.
- Identify the corresponding output value paired with that input value.

To solve a function in tabular form, perform the following steps:

- Find the given output values in the row (or the column) of output values, every
  time noting when an output value appears.
- Identify the input value(s) corresponding to the given output value.

## Notations for the Domain and Range of a Function

Earlier, when we worked with functions represented as sets of ordered pairs, we
used lists to describe the domain and range of such functions. An alternative way
to write the domain and range of a function is using **inequality notation**. If,
for example, the input variable can take values greater than or equal to -8 but
less than 15, we will write the domain as -8<x<15. However, there are two more
ways to specify the domain and range that are commonly used, **set-builder notation**
and **interval notation**.

**Set-builder notation** is a method of specifying a set of elements that satisfy
a certain condition. It takes the form `{x| statement about x}`. The braces {} are
read as "the set of," and the vertical bar | is read as "such that." So
`{x| statement about x}` is read as "the set of all x such that the statement about
x is true."

To combine two intervals using set-builder notation, as well as using inequality
notation, we use the word "or."
{x|x<0 or 1<x<5}

Interval notation uses values within brackets [] to describe a set of numbers. In
interval notation, we use a square bracket [] when the set includes the endpoint
and a parenthesis () to indicate that the endpoint is either not included or the
interval is unbounded. On a number line, a closed (or filled) circle is used to
represent a square bracket, and an open circle is used to represent a parenthesis.

Conventions of the interval notation:

- The smallest term from the interval is written first.
- The largest term in the interval is written second, following a comma.
- Parentheses, ( or ), are used to signify that an endpoint is not included; it
  is called exclusive.
- Brackets,[ or ], are used to indicate that an endpoint is included; it is called
  inclusive.

**Interval notation** is a way of describing sets that include all real numbers
between a lower limit that may or may not be included and an upper limit that may
or may not be included. The endpoint values are listed between brackets or parentheses.
A square bracket indicates inclusion in the set, and a parenthesis indicates exclusion
from the set.

|Inequality Notation |  Set-builder Notation |  Interval Notation            |
|--------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1<x<=4             | {x|1<x<=4}            |  (1,4}                        |
| 1<=x<4             | {x|1<=x<4}            |  [1,4)                        |
| 1<x<4              | {x|1<x<4}             |  (1,4)                        |
| x<4                | {x|x<4}               | (-бесконечность,4)            |
| x>=1               | {x|1>=x}              | [1, бесконечность)            |
|All real numbers    | R                     |(-бесконечность, бесконечность)|

Remember that, when writing or reading interval notation, using a closed circle
or a square bracket means the boundary is included in the set. Using an open
circle or a parenthesis means the boundary is not included in the set.

{x|x=/5} represents the whole real number line except x = 5,
(-бесконечность,5) and (5,бесконечность)

{x|x=/-+1} represents the whole real number line except x = -1 and x = 1
(-бесконечность,-1) and (-1,1) and (1,бесконечность)

## Finding the Domain and Range of a Function

### The Domain and Range of a Function in Formula Form

When finding the domain of functions whose formula is provided, oftentimes, one
of the three scenarios takes place. First, if the function has no denominator
or an odd root, consider whether the domain could be all real numbers. Second,
if there is a denominator in the function’s formula, exclude values in the domain
that force the denominator to be zero. Third, if there is an even root, consider
excluding values that would make the radicand negative.

To determine the domain and range of a function given in formula form, perform
the following steps:

- Identify the input values.

  - If there is a denominator, exclude the input values that turn the denominator
    to zero.
  - If there is an even root, exclude the input values that lead to extracting an
    even root of a negative number.

- Use the valid input values to determine the range of the output values.

- Write the domain and range in interval form.

## Piecewise Functions

Sometimes, we come across a function that requires more than one formula in order
to obtain the given output.

One of the examples of a piecewise function is the absolute value function
f(x) = |x|. With a domain of all real numbers and a range of values greater than
or equal to 0, absolute value can be defined as the magnitude, or modulus, of a
real number value regardless of sign. It is the distance from 0 on the number line.
All of these definitions require the output to be greater than or equal to 0.

If we input 0, or a positive value, the output is the same as the input. If we
input a negative value, the output is the opposite of the input. In piecewise
notation, the absolute value function is
|x| = { x if x>=0
       -x if x<0}

In terms of real-life examples, we can use a piecewise function to describe a
system of discounts on a cumulative discount card, for example.
D(p) = {5  if 100<=p<500
        10 if 500<=p<1000
        15 if 1000>p}

The domain of this function is all possible values of p, that is [100, бесконечность).
The range is all possible outputs, that is 5, 10, or 15 or {5,10,15}.

A piecewise function is a function in which more than one formula is used to define
the output. Each formula has its own domain, and the domain of the function is the
union of all these smaller domains. We notate this idea like this:
