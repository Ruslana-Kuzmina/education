# Cloud Overview

## Cloud Core Concepts

The **cloud** provides a way of abstracting, pooling, and sharing computing
resources—like servers, switches, routers, operating systems, and security software
— across a network of devices on or off the premises. **Cloud computing** refers
to the use of these resources over the Internet. Typically, users rent computational
resources like storage space or CPU power, while the cloud provider actively manages
the hardware (e.g. storage drives and servers) that provide those computational
resources. Cloud providers also offer higher level services that analyze data,
support disaster recovery, or act as development environments—all of which run
on cloud provider hardware.

In the real world, utilities serve certain purposes, and so does the cloud in
business. **Cloud projects** strive to adopt cloud technologies as much as possible
to achieve business goals. To make the most of cloud functionality, companies
engage **cloud specialists** to see to the technological aspects of working with
clouds and help solve business problems.

In contrast to your typical utilities, the cloud leverages a mixture of technologies
such as an operating system, a management platform, and APIs. Each of these technologies
includes the option to use virtualization and automation software. As a result,
there are hundreds of different cloud resource types and multiple options for each.

### The benefits of cloud computing

- Cost efficiency

Cloud computing provides a pay-as-you-go or consumption-based pricing model. Rather
than paying upfront for a predefined amount of computing resources or hardware,
you can rent what you need and pay only for the resources you use.
This consumption-based model offers many benefits, including:

- No up-front costs
- No need to purchase, understand, or manage costly infrastructure
- The ability to scale resources up and down, based on need
- The ability to change your mind about resource types or sizing

These benefits help organizations minimize financial risk, especially when starting
a project. Once a project is up and running, the cloud vendor should provide cost
reporting, cost predictions based on current trends, and cost modeling based on
historical data. As your service stabilizes, you may be able to further optimize
costs by committing to a minimum spend or even reserving resources.

- Scalability

Scalability is the ability to increase or decrease IT resources as needed to meet
changing demand. Both vertical and horizontal scaling are supported in the cloud,
depending on your client’s needs.

**Vertical scaling** involves increasing the size of each resource—for example,
adding more CPU power or memory to existing servers.
**Horizontal scaling** involves adding more resources to your existing clusters—most
likely of the same size as existing servers.

- Elasticity

Here, elasticity refers to the ability to provide or remove resources on demand
as your organization's needs change. Through a process called "auto-scaling," a
cloud computing system can automatically add or remove resources to compensate
for fluctuations in workload.

- Service variety

Cloud provider services can vary significantly and encompass a wide variety of
capabilities. Cloud providers can be used for traditional IT infrastructures such
as servers, storage, and networks. They also offer more advanced services and
frameworks like artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT).

- Reliability

The cloud provides a sense of confidence that your servers and data will always
be there. Cloud computing providers offer data backup, disaster recovery, and data
replication services to make sure your data is always safe. In addition, cloud
providers offer various resilience options for your servers: They provide data
and insights to help monitor applications, respond to performance changes, and give
a unified view of operational health.

- Security

Cloud providers help your organization maintain a high level of security. Through
a broad set of policies, technologies, controls, and expert technical skills, cloud
providers offer a much better security toolkit than most organizations could achieve
on premises. Companies can leverage these tools and services to strengthen security.

## Cloud Types

### Deployment Models

Deployment models can differ in terms of location and owner. Maximizing the benefits
of the cloud requires choosing the correct cloud model for your workloads and data.

- Private Cloud

  Private cloud service runs on dedicated hardware. It often serves as a bridge between
  the public cloud and legacy on-premises systems. A private cloud's capacity is
  static, based on how much storage has been paid for; it can be run internally or
  by an independent contractor.
  This is a step toward a public cloud for many organizations, allowing solutions
  around security and data sovereignty to be resolved before moving to a public cloud.

- Public Cloud

  Public clouds are run by a specialist provider in their data centers and are
  accessible via the internet or private connections. They do not require an independent
  data center space for system maintenance or the purchase of hardware or software.

  Moving to a public cloud is an economical solution for organizations seeking to
  avoid capital expenses. However, if you are considering migration, you will want
  to thoroughly assess your cloud provider's security model; the public cloud is
  only a good deal if it keeps your data secure.

- Hybrid Cloud

  Hybrid clouds are computing environments that use a mixture of on-premises data
  storage, private cloud, and third-party public cloud services. These environments
  work together to perform a single task. A combination of these environments allows
  businesses to fulfill their unique needs by tailoring which services they use—for
  example, your organization may not be ready to move to the cloud entirely or may
  have some highly sensitive data that you'd rather store in a private cloud.

- Multi-Cloud

  Multi-cloud is a strategy in which multiple computing and storage services are
  used in a single heterogeneous architecture. It aims to distribute cloud assets,
  software, and applications across several cloud-hosting environments, eliminating
  the need to rely on a single provider.

  This approach differs from a hybrid cloud in that the cloud services can function
  either independently or together, as opposed to multiple types of infrastructure
  functioning collectively (e.g., a data center, private cloud, and a public cloud).

The type of deployment model you select should be based on the number of programs
you want to run, how much storage space you need, and your organizational aims.
