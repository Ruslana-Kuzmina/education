# The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
- **Requirement definition** - During the Requirement Definition stage, a Business Analyst collects the input from stakeholders trying to understand their 'true' needs and what goals they are trying to pursue. In addition, the objectives of the initiative are defined, and a Business Analyst ensures that everyone involved has a shared understanding of those objectives.
- **Analysis** - During the Analysis stage, a Business Analyst elaborates on the high-level requirements received in the previous phase. Further to that, the team determines the cost and resources required for implementing the identified requirements. The risks associated with the initiative are analyzed to work out the mitigation plan if needed.
- **Design** - During the Design stage, solution architecture is designed and described in a document. Moreover, the phase implies creating prototypes of the envisioned solution. Generally, prototyping proved itself to be useful for getting early feedback and eliminating risks associated with future development.
- **Coding** - During the Analysis stage, a Business Analyst elaborates on the high-level requirements received in the previous phase. Further to that, the team determines the cost and resources required for implementing the identified requirements. The risks associated with the initiative are analyzed to work out the mitigation plan if needed.
- **Assurance** - During the Quality Assurance stage, the product is tested to confirm its quality and value for end users. Any issues found during the testing process should be fixed until the software meets the expected quality guidelines.
- **Deployment** - During the Deployment stage, the software is deployed to the production environment so that end users can start using it.
- **Maintenance** - During the Maintenance stage, the existing product might be enhanced with new features, or any errors detected by real customers will be fixed as a part of this phase. Active development is not expected during the Maintenance stage; however, the product should constantly evolve to support fast-changing business needs.

## SDLC models
### Traditional
Are plan-driven and are focused on minimizing the upfront uncertainty and maximizing control. Software development governed by a traditional methodology has a sequential flow where the next phase does not start until the previous one finishes.

#### Waterfall model
Phases:
- Requirements
- Analysis
- Design
- Coding/Implementation


### Agile
