# Application

## Types of applications:

### Web application
It's accessible via a browser

#### Advantages
- Anyone with the Internet service can access
- It can run on multiple platforms
- It needs to be updated on a server and all the users will instantly get the same version of the software
- It is usually faster to build and easier to maintain compared to other application types

#### Limitations
- It is more vulnerable to security attacks
- It might not be supported by all browsers
- It does not have access to the system resources like CPU, memory, and the file system

#### The examples
Google Docs, Trello, Netflix, Gmail


### Mobile application
It's a program that can be downloaded and installed on a smartphone or a tablet using application directories (for example, Google Play, Apple Store)

#### Advantages
It can access all features that modern devices have, such as GPS, a camera, Bluetooth


### Native app (mobile)
Is written in the native programming language of a device and can function only on the platform it is designed for

#### Disadvantages
- A native application cannot offer a cross-platform experience
- Each platform (Android, iOS) will require creating a separate native application which drastically increases the cost of development


### Hybrid app (mobile)
The features of both a web application and a native application

#### Advantages
It provides cross-platform capabilities

#### Disadvantages
Hybrid applications have lower performance


### Desktop application
It is installed on a computer

#### Advantages
- A desktop application is more secure
- It is exposed to a large number of users
- Desktop apps are standalone in nature, that is why they do not rely on Internet connectivity and speed


## Application Creation Process
- **Ideation** - is to come up with ideas for a potential product and select the best one that will be further worked on
- **Conception** - is to make a GO/NOT-GO decision about the product. A business case is created to capture the results of the market assessment, to provide a high-level description of the product and its unique value for customers
- **Elaboration** - is to define what functionalities should be included in the product and what user tasks it will be able to solve (planning, requirements)
- **Design** - baseline architecture will be described and documented. Understanding of how the product will look, its visual design concepts, and the main user flows
- **Development** - the system will be created and tested to ensure that it meets the requirements and user needs
- **Introduction** - means that the product will be available to a wider audience

A **soft launch** is a preview release of a product to a limited audience prior to the general public. Companies create a **minimum viable product (MVP)**, a basic version of the product that covers the core requirements and needs of end users


## Business Analyst's Journey from Ideation to Introduction

### Team:
- **Product owner** - makes key decisions, defines the next priorities, ensures that the value is constantly delivered, and gathers product-related feedback
- **Business analyst** - is responsible for eliciting, documenting, and approving requirements. A BA ensures that the product will satisfy business and user needs
- **Developer** - is responsible for producing clean and efficient code
	* **A Back-End Developer** - deals with the internal world of an application: application logic, database, integrations, and other back-end processes
	* **A Front-End Developer** - implements the visual design of an application and its interactive elements
	* **A Full-Stack Developer** - has the skills of both
- **Tester** - is responsible for preparing and executing test cases. A Tester ensures that the quality of a system is high enough to support user operations
- **Devops** - is responsible for building, testing, and maintaining infrastructure to develop and release a product in a fast and efficient manner
- **Architect** - creates and documents the architectural vision of the system. In addition, he/she ensures that the system design supports long-term business objectives
- **UX-UI designer** - creates the look and feel of the system: visual concepts, interface elements, user flows, and a lot more

### Some of the business analysis activities and how they correlate with each phase process:
- **Ideation** - A BA collaborates with a Product Owner and other business stakeholders
	* Facilitate the ideation process applying an appropriate business analysis toolkit (for example, brainstorming, mind mapping, interviewing)
	* Ensure that product ideas are collected, recorded, and properly evaluated
	* Assist with defining criteria for evaluating product ideas
	* Summarize and present the information in an easy to understand and follow manner
- **Conception** - A BA collaborates with a Product Owner and a System Architect
	* Define high-level business requirements
	* Define a preliminary solution and get bulk estimates of this solution
	* Assist in creating a business case
- **Elaboration**
	* Elicit and document user requirements
	* Capture functional and non-functional system requirements
	* Identify assumptions and constraints
	* Define the scope of a system in terms of what will and will not be supported by the system
	* Create high-level epics for the future backlog
- **Design** - A BA collaborates with a System Architect and a Product Owner
	* Verify the solution architecture design against business requirements, high-level solution requirements, internal company's operations, compliance, and security policies
- **Development** -  BA collaborates with the whole team
	* Break down epics into stories and define acceptance criteria
	* Assist a PO in backlog prioritization
	* Support the team during the product development by answering questions and providing additional information
	* Manage the scope of the solution
	* Present the product to business stakeholders
	* Write user guides and other product-related documentation
- **Introduction** - BA collaborates with a Product Owner
	* Conduct user acceptance sessions and gather feedback
	* Document improvements so that they can be prioritized for future releases
