- Summary
- Test team
- Testing process description
- Timetable
- New defects statistics
- New defects list
- Overall defects statistics
- Recommendations
- Attachments / appendixes

**Summary** – a very brief and meaningful description of the main results, achievements, problems, etc. – all that **really** worth mentioning.

With best case scenario most stakeholders may only read Summary and get all the
necessary information they want.

**Test team** – a section containing the list of testers involved in the project
during the reporting time. (Name Role Responsibility)

**Testing process description** – a section containing **not** final facts and
conclusions, but literally the description of what and how the test team has been
doing.

**Timetable** – is a section containing... the timetable ☺, i.e. automatic data
export from time reporting system. It helps to see the workload, time distribution,
time consumption and so on. (Name Date Activity Duration, hours)

**New defects statistics** – is a section, containing the numbers of defects
found/fixed/etc during the reporting time. This is theautomatic export from bug-tracking
system.

**New defects list** – is a section, containing the list of defects found during
the reporting time. This is the automatic export from bug-tracking system. 
(ID Severity Summary)

**Overall defects statistics** – is a section, containing the numbers of **all**
defects found/fixed/etc from the beginning of the project. This is the automatic
