**Testing** – the process concerned with planning, preparation and evaluation of
software products and related work products to determine that they satisfy
specified requirements, to demonstrate that they are fit for purpose and to detect
defects.

**Quality** – the degree to which a component, system or process meets specified
requirements and/or user/customer needs and expectations.

**Quality management** – coordinated activities to direct and control an organization
with regard to quality.

**Quality assurance** – part of quality management focused on providing confidence
that quality requirements will be fulfilled.

**Quality control** – the operational techniques and activities, part of quality
management, that are focused on fulfilling quality requirements.

**Defect** – an imperfection or deficiency in a work product where it does not meet
its requirements or specifications.

**Expected result** – the predicted observable behavior of a component or system
executing under specified conditions, based on its specification or another source.

**Actual result** – the behavior produced/observed when a component or system is
tested.

**Checklist** – a set of ideas.

**Test case** – a set of preconditions, inputs, actions (where applicable), expected
results and postconditions, developed based on test conditions.

**Test suite** – a set of test cases or test procedures to be executed in a specific
test cycle.

Software testing lifecycle:

1.General planning and requirements analysis

Here we have to find out: what to test; how much work is ahead;
what difficulties we may face; do we have all necessary resources; are
requirements good enough.

2.Acceptance criteria establishment

Here we have to establish or adjust metrics and criteria for test
process to start, pause, resume, complete or abort. We also have to
know key quality criteria and goals for the current test cycle.

3.Test strategy establishment

Once again we return to planning to find out HOW shall we achieve
all those goals and criteria from the previous step. Here we speak
about approaches, tools, schedule, roles, responsibility and so on.

4.Test cases creation

Here we create, review, adjust, rework (and so on) checklists, test
cases, test scenarios and other similar artifacts.

5.Test cases execution
6.Defect reporting

These two stages are inseparable as we report defects during test
cases execution and defects detection.

7.Test results analysis
8.Test results reporting

Here we analyze if we managed to achieve the goals set during stages
1-3. The result of such analysis is presented in Test Result Report and
used as the basis for the planning of the next test cycle.

Stages 1,2,3: General planning and requirements analysis, Acceptance criteria
establishment, Test strategy establishment-> Planning

Stage 4,5,6: Test cases creation, Test cases execution, Defect reporting -> Actions

Stages 7,8: Test results analysis, Test results reporting -> Reviewing, analyzing,
preparation for the next iteraction
