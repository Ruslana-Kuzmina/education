# Introduction to Test Planning

## Test Planning and its tasks and goals

**Test planning** – the activity of establishing or updating a test plan.

**Test plan** – documentation describing the test objectives to be achieved and
the means and the schedule for achieving them, organized to coordinate testing
activities.

Planning Tasks and Goals:

- Estimation of work scope and complexity
- Designation of resources and ways to acquire them
- Definition of schedule and milestones
- Risk mitigation and countermeasures definition
- Distribution of duties and responsibilities
- Coordination of team-effort between teams/projects/groups

Test Plan helps us to:

- Get better results with less effort
- Optimize resources usage, avoid waste
- See the progress at any given moment
- Understand what to do in any situation
- Get better understanding between people
- Cooperate better

## Test Plan Sections

- **Project scope and main goals** – a very brief description of the purpose of the
application development. This section is reminiscent of business requirements, but
here the information is presented in an even more condensed form with an emphasis
on the most important tasks.

- **Requirements to be tested** – the list of functional and / or non-functional
requirements to be tested. Not each and every requirement should be tested. Here we
list those ones that should be covered with test-cases.

- **Requirements NOT to be tested** – the list of functional and / or non-functional
requirements NOT to be tested. As not each and every requirement should be tested,
here we list those ones that should NOT be covered with test-cases. For each
requirement we write the reason why shouldn't we test it.

- **Test strategy and approach** – the description of the testing process in terms
of the methods used, approaches, types of testing, technologies, tools, etc. This
description allows us to use the most effective and efficient way to achieve project
goals in terms of quality.

- **Criteria** – the list of miscellaneous testing criteria, such as acceptance
criteria, entry criteria, suspension criteria, resumption criteria, exit criteria,
etc. Usually, each criterion has a reference to proper metric.

- **Resources** – the list of miscellaneous project resources, such as software,
hardware, staff, time, finance, etc. Usually, finance resources are too confidential
to be included in test-plan, so only a reference to the budget is mentioned here.

- **Schedule** – in fact, this is a kind of calendar with milestones and periods
marked on it. When the project is long enough (months and years long) there is no
need to have a detailed schedule for the far future: the schedule may be adjusted
and filled with details once we reach one milestone or another.

- **Roles and responsibilities** – the list of all key project roles (related to
the testing process) with their key areas of responsibility. Though this list is
rather unified for most projects, there may be some special cases, so this section
usually is not omitted.

- **Risk evaluation** – the list of risks that are likely to arise during the project.
For each risk there is a probability evaluation and some options for resolving the
situation. There are a lot of typical risks (actual for every project) so no need
to list such risks here. This section is for risks specific (or even unique) to
the project.

- **Documentation** – the list of test documentation with details on who should
prepare it, when, how, etc. This section is extremely useful when onboarding a new
project member. As sometimes documentation list may consist of dozens of items,
it’s good to have them listed in one place.

- **Metrics** – the list of numerical characteristics of quality indicators, methods
for their evaluation, formulas, etc. This section is actively referenced by “Criteria”
section. Metrics have their dark side too, but in general it is better to have some
objective way to tell the current project situation.
