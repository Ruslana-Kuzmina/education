# Test Strategy and Test Plan

- Test Plan and Test Strategy
- Test Plan sections

A **Test Plan** is defined as a document which outlines the scope, objective, method
and weight on a software testing task

**Test plan** – documentation describing the test objectives to be achieved and
the means and the schedule for achieving them, organized to coordinate testing
activities.

**Test Strategy** in software testing is defined as a set of guiding principles
that determines the test design & regulates how the software testing process will
be done. The objective of the Test Strategy is to provide a systematic approach
to the software testing process in order to ensure the quality, traceability,
reliability and better planning.

## Test Plan Sections

- **Project scope and main goals** – a very brief description of the purpose of the
  application development. This section is reminiscent of business requirements,
  but here the information is presented in an even more condensed form with an emphasis
  on the most important tasks.

- **Requirements to be tested** – the list of functional and / or non-functional
  requirements to be tested. Not each and every requirement should be tested. Here
  we list those oneTesting Strategys that should be covered with test-cases.

- **Requirements NOT to be tested** – the list of functional and / or non-functional
  requirements NOT to be tested. As not each and every requirement should be tested,
  here we list those ones that should NOT be covered with test-cases. For each
  requirement we write the reason why shouldn't we test it.

- **Test strategy and approach** – the description of the testing process in terms
  of the methods used, approaches, types of testing, technologies, tools, etc. This
  description allows us to use the most effective and efficient way to achieve project
  goals in terms of quality.

- **Criteria** – the list of miscellaneous testing criteria, such as acceptance
  criteria, entry criteria, suspension criteria, resumption criteria, exit criteria,
  etc. Usually, each criterion has a reference to proper metric.

- **Resources** – the list of miscellaneous project resources, such as software,
  hardware, staff, time, finance, etc. Usually, finance resources are too confidential
  to be included in test-plan, so only a reference to the budget is mentioned here.

- **Schedule** – in fact, this is a kind of calendar with milestones and periods
  marked on it. When the project is long enough (months and years long) there is
  no need to have a detailed schedule for the far future: the schedule may be
  adjusted and filled with details once we reach one milestone or another.

- **Roles and responsibilities** – the list of all key project roles (related to
  the testing process) with their key areas of responsibility. Though this list is
  rather unified for most projects, there may be some special cases, so this section
  usually is not omitted.

- **Risk evaluation** – the list of risks that are likely to arise during the project.
  For each risk there is a probability evaluation and some options for resolving
  the situation. There are a lot of typical risks (actual for every project) so
  no need to list such risks here. This section is for risks specific (or even
  unique) to the project.

- **Documentation** – the list of test documentation with details on who should
  prepare it, when, how, etc. This section is extremely useful when onboarding a
  new project member. As sometimes documentation list may consist of dozens of
  items, it’s good to have them listed in one place.

- **Metrics** – the list of numerical characteristics of quality indicators,
  methods or their evaluation, formulas, etc. This section is actively referenced
  by “Criteria” section. Metrics have their dark side too, but in general it is
  better to have some objective way to tell the current project situation.

Test Strategy includes the following components:

- Testing Strategy Overview
- Background
- Scope
- Constraints
- Key Inputs
- Task Overview
- Key Deliverables
- Acceptance Criteria
- Problem Management
- Critical Success Factors
- Risk and Contingency Plans
- Metrics

The Testing Strategy can provide the following benefits:

- faster development of testing requirements by directly using key project deliverables
- earlier identification of testing requirements
- independence of testing from development tasks and resources
- well-defined tests
- progressive and additive test tasks

Key Difference Between Test Plan and Test Strategy:

- Test Plan is a document that describes the scope, objective and weight on software
  testing task whereas Test Strategy describes how testing needs to be done.
- Test Plan is used at the project level whereas Test Strategy is used at the
  organization level.
- Test Plan has the primary goal of how to test, when to test and who will verify
  whereas Test Strategy has the primary goal of what technique to follow and which
  module to check.
- Test Plan can be changed whereas Test Strategy can’t change.
- Test Plan is carried out by the test manager whereas the Test Strategy is carried
  out by the project manager.
- Components of Test plan include - Test plan id, features to be tested, test
  techniques, testing tasks, features pass or fail criteria, test deliverables,
  responsibilities, and schedule, etc. Components of Test strategy includes - 
  objectives and scope, documentation formats, test processes, team reporting structure,
  client communication strategy, etc.
