# Public Cloud Platforms Overview

## AWS

Amazon was the first company to offer cloud infrastructure to developers at other
companies. This head start allowed Amazon to have the largest share of the cloud
computing market as of July, 2021 according to Gartner research.

The company offers a complete range of IaaS and PaaS services. Among the most popular
are its Elastic Beanstalk, Elastic Block Store (EBS), Glacier storage, Relational
Database Service (RDS), and DynamoDB NoSQL database. It also offers cloud services
related to networking, analytics and machine learning, the Internet of Things (IoT),
mobile services, development, cloud management, cloud security and more.

Two of the earliest AWS offerings are still among their most well-known,
**Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)** and **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)**.

1.S3 is like a developer's version of Dropbox that can automatically scale across
millions of gigabytes.

2.EC2 allows teams to rent machine instances that are analogous to setting up physical
machines, but without the physical effort or up-front hardware purchases.

**AWS Lambda** is an event-driven, serverless computing platform service that runs
code in response to events. Lambda costs less to maintain and operate than EC2,
but the former is not suitable for code that runs longer than a few minutes, and
migrating on-premises applications to Lambda will likely require significant code
rewrites and testing.

Over the years, Amazon has developed an ecosystem around their cloud offerings. Plus,
Amazon launches new cloud features and changes at a fast pace, so there's always
something new to consider.

## GCP

Google has a reputation for designing simple-to-use consumer products that are also
technically advanced.

Like Amazon and Microsoft, Google offers an extensive range of IaaS and PaaS services
that span compute, storage, networking, big data, machine learning, developer tools
and security. Some of its best-known cloud offerings include **Compute Engine,**
**App Engine, Container Engine, Cloud Storage and BigQuery**.

When the millennial Snapchat founder started building their app in 2011, they
found AWS too overwhelming and decided to use **Google App Engine** instead. Today,
App Engine is part of the GCP and continues to offer a PaaS developer experience
that requires less infrastructure configuration than creating virtual machines.
App Engine is also marketed as a serverless platform.

Google had also created and/or contributed to many of the most popular open source
projects, and it infuses its cloud offerings with that expertise. The big data
capabilities are augmented by Google’s inexpensive cloud storage, which makes this
cloud platform cost effective for storing large volumes of data.

## MS Azure

Microsoft has strong brand recognition and usage among enterprises, which has helped
its Azure cloud platform gain popularity. A lot of companies already use Microsoft
SQL Server, Windows Server, .NET, Active Directory, and other products, so it’s
logical for them to consider Azure for their cloud needs.

MS Azure cloud portfolio is exhaustive: in addition to its Azure IaaS and PaaS
offerings, Microsoft also has several SaaS offerings, including its Office 365
products, the online versions of its Dynamics line of enterprise software and its
online developer tools.

Thanks to Microsoft's experience working with enterprises, Azure has risen to the
number-two market share position after Amazon (Gartner, 2021). What makes Microsoft
Azure different is that it offers a combination of ease of use and the ability to
work with on-premises environments to create a hybrid approach to cloud computing.

**Azure Cosmos DB** is one of the most popular cloud computing services offered
by Azure. This fully managed NoSQL database service is designed to ensure
single-digit millisecond response times. Businesses leverage this service to
facilitate faster writes and reads across the globe.

Azure also has a wide range of networking capabilities, including support for
multiple site-to-site connections and virtual networks, as well as the ability to
connect virtual networks to each other across different regions.

Finally, Microsoft Azure has a very vibrant ecosystem of partnerships with other
technology vendors. For example, it has relationships with Red Hat, Canonical,
Citrix, HPE, Adobe, SAP, Cisco and many others, that enhance the services it is
able to offer customers.
