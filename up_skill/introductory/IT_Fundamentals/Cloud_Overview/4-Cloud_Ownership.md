# Cloud Ownership

## Adopting a cloud solution

### Assessment: Cloud economics

In its most basic form, cloud economics is the study of the concepts, costs, and
benefits of cloud computing. It helps an organization figure out how adopting cloud
will affect its IT budget, security, and infrastructure.

One of the most topical questions your clients might have, is: “How does a company
calculate the cost of moving to cloud?”. That’s where cloud economics come in
especially handy with its concept of total cost of ownership, or TCO.

The **total cost of ownership** in cloud computing refers to the total cost of
implementing, running, and provisioning cloud infrastructure. TCO analysis helps
organizations find out the difference between how much it takes to run current
on-premises systems versus how much cloud adoption and operation would cost. However,
there is a small obstacle in correctly calculating the TCO—it usually applies to
static resources, whereas cloud infrastructure is dynamic, which may influence its
final cost.

Besides that, an organization needs to capture all of the hidden and intangible
costs of its current infrastructure and of a possible cloud solution. The information
below can help you describe what needs to be calculated to the clients trying to
decide whether cloud would be more economically relevant to their company.

- Cost of the current data centre

  The first step is to estimate how much time, money and infrastructure is currently
  required in running a data center. To do it precisely, a company needs to make
  sure to include all aspects. For instance, IT infrastructure can include physical
  servers, software licenses, service contracts, warranties, supplies, material,
  spare parts, and anything else that an organization may pay for directly. Then
  there are the operating costs, including labor, IT hardware storage facilities,
  and internet access.

- Cost of the estimated cloud infractructure

  After identifying the cost of the current data center, a company needs to figure
  out how much cloud infrastructure will cost. While cloud price varies depending
  on various criteria, it is up to a cloud provider to present a more straightforward
  pricing structure.

- Cost of cloud migration execution

  It is also vital to factor in the costs of implementing the IT operations migration
  to the cloud. The size of organization's current IT infrastructure and how much
  of it they plan to move to the cloud will define this. Additionally, there are
  costs associated with app integration and testing, as well as consultation fees.

- Additional post-migration cost

  Many cloud providers charge a monthly infrastructure fee to keep a cloud environment
  running smoothly. To calculate an accurate post-migration budget, a company must
  estimate the costs of continuous integration and testing of apps, training, labor,
  security, compliance, administration, and other possible activities.

### Preparation: Cloud migration strategy

**Cloud migration** involves moving your applications and data store from on-premises
hosting sites to the cloud. Cloud migration is similar to a physical relocation but
instead of packing and transferring real objects, it entails moving data, apps,
and IT processes from one data center to another. While the concept is straightforward,
its implementation is complex, requiring in-depth planning and a well-formulated
strategy.

A **cloud migration strategy** provides the roadmap for getting this done and offers
various benefits to organizations. The preparation step is all about building the
right strategy and following it through the next stage—migration.

Considerations in Cloud Migration

When you migrate products to the cloud, you discover a new range of
ossibilities—previously unimaginable ways to interact with customers, use and share
data, and design and develop products. Making cloud a priority requires a strong
understanding of these and other opportunities and a clear sense of how they can
help your projects improve and innovate.

When you or your clients prepare for the migration process, think about the questions
below when building a strategy.

1.What do you gain from and lose becuse of migration?
2.Which cloud provider suits best?
3.Which option has a sufficient securuty level?
4.How much agility is necessary?

ASSESSING CLOUD READINESS:

1.What do the applications run on?
2.Are there any dependencies on hardware or middleware?
3.What will it take to move the applications and data to the cloud?
4.What are the necessary time commitments?

CAN'T MOVE TO CLOUD:

- keys for electronic security
- systems requiring a high level of performance to function properly
- licensing limitations on software
- services not thoroughly tested
- programs that must be run on actual hardware
- systems that require a higher level of security

## Migration: approaches

- Minimizing the impact on end users
- Reducing risk

Gartner 7Rs:

- retain
- rehost
- replatform
- refactor
- rearchitect
- rebuild
- replace

## Migration: process

- Set objectives

  What improvements in performance does a company anticipate to see? When will
  legacy infrastructure be phased out? Setting goals to measure against aids a
  company in determining whether or not the migration was effective.

- Create a security strategy

  In comparison to on-premises security, cloud security needs a distinct approach.
  Corporate assets are no longer protected by a firewall, and the network perimeter
  is practically non-existent in the cloud. It may be essential to deploy a cloud
  firewall or a web application firewall.

- Copy data over

  Choose a cloud provider and back up your existing databases. This should be done
  on a regular basis throughout the migration process to keep the cloud database
  current.

- Move business intelligence

  This may entail code reworking or rewriting. It can be completed in stages or
  fully at once.

- Shift production to cloud

  The cloud is live and the migration is finished.

## Cloud operations

Cloud Operations, or CloudOps, is a term that refers to the network, security,
performance, device management, help desk, and other responsibilities that keep
cloud-native apps and underlying infrastructure fully operational. It's a formalization
of best practices, procedures, and services that allow platforms, applications, and
data in the cloud to function consistently for long periods.

As opposed to traditional operations, CloudOps tools and skill sets align more
closely with development. They rely on automation with a focus on prevention and
proactive mitigation rather than reactive detection and reporting. CloudOps also
promotes leveraging APIs to provision and administer assets.

To make sure a client's company cloud journey is successful, you need to explain
your clients that they must be responsible for driving cultural change and enabling
team members to work in new Ops fashion. They can do this by educating engineers
and giving them the right tools to perform their new functions.

## CloudOps Best practices

- Ensure Transparency

  Your security or governance team must understand every aspect of your cloud journey.
  If teams fail to collaborate, they'll complicate the adoption process, and the
  final effect will be a lack of transparency and organizational cohesion. Instead
  of introducing more limitations, establish and implement appropriate guidelines
  from the start.

- Automate Security

  Implement automation processes and test the configuration of cloud resources to
  reduce security concerns. As the organization's cloud footprint expands and evolves,
  automating security assessments and having clear compliance procedures assures
  consistency.

- Implement Redundancy

  Continuous operations and minimal downtime are some of the goals of the CloudOps
  philosophy. Using automation and redundancy at both the cloud provider and
  application layers ensures that the application remains available despite updates
  or software changes.

- Improve continuously

  An effective CloudOps strategy isn't a one-size-fits-all solution that can be
  implemented in just one step. The ultimate goal is to combine numerous teams with
  various skill sets into a fully integrated operation. To do so, you'll need to
  continuously work on communication methods, tools, processes, and budget management.
  Make a strategy for not only the first transition time but also future
  optimization possibilities.
