# How to answer top 3 job interview questions

Question 1. Could you tell me about yourself?

There are two important rules to follow when preparing to answer this question:

- Adapt your response to the job.
  You should highlight your skills and experience as they relate to the job
  description and the organization. Stick to what matters professionally and think
  about the qualities that are needed for your new position.
  Your goal is to show the interviewer that you have the desired skill set and can
  benefit from the position.

- Structure your answer clearly.
  You can describe what you are doing now and then move on to what you have done
  in your work and education to achieve that. Then you can discuss where you want
  to go next and why.

Remember!

You should avoid irrelevant and personal details and shouldn't tell the story of
your entire life. Keep your answer brief, clear and structured, and consider what
key qualities this job requires.

Question 2. What are your greatest strengths?

Although the interviewer may not ask you this exact question, they will probably
use some of the following options:

- What are you good at?
- How would we benefit from hiring you?
- What skills would you bring to this role?

They want to know why you think you're a perfect match for the job. Consider what
strengths a new employee should have to succeed in this position based on the job
description and your company research. Then think about your own skills and select
the ones that fit the description. Be careful about the words you use and avoid clichés.

Remember!

You shouldn't claim that you have competence if you can't support it with details.
The interviewer may ask you to talk in more detail about your skills or give an
example of a problem you've solved. Listing too many strengths isn't advisable
either. Choosing two or three most important and relevant ones is a good idea.

Example:
I've always considered myself a problem solver. I have the ability to see a situation
from different perspectives. I also feel that my communication skills are top-notch.
I am rather good at settling team conflicts.

Question 3. Why do you want this job?

This question is a great opportunity to demonstrate your enthusiasm for the new
role and show why you would succeed in it. Be sure to give specific reasons why
you want to get this job. Show that you don't just need work but want this particular
job. Of course, the interviewer wants to hire someone who is not only enthusiastic
but also has qualifications. Demonstrate a full understanding of the organization's
mission and show that it meets your professional goals.

Remember!

Don't be too practical in your answer here. "Because I need money for mortgage,
food and clothes" is not a great answer, even if it's the truth.

Also, don't be too general. Don't say anything like "I heard this company is a great
place to work." Be more specific.

What kind of person would you refuse to work with? Honestly, I wouldn't like to
cooperate with ... Do not be trivial. You shouldn't mention disloyalty to the company,
violence or lawbreaking.

What has disappointed you about your job? I have been disappointed by ...
Do not get negative or talk about trivial problems. You can mention, for example,
that the work was not enough of a challenge, that it was a dead-end job, or that
there was no job satisfaction.

What are your interests and hobbies? I'm really into ...It is wise to mention the
ones that are somehow connected to your new position.

What would make you stay in your previous job? I have already made up my mind to
leave but probably ... Speak about benefits that you didn't have earlier and that
you would have at this job. Do not say anything about money. Emphasize your personal
development.

Why should we hire you? I believe I am a perfect match for this position because
... Show how your assets (valuable skills) meet what the company needs. Do not mention
any other candidates and don't compare.

Do you mind working long hours? I'd prefer not to work at nights or weekends as ...
This is up to you, but don't lie. And don't forget to give a proper reason.

What are your weaknesses?

To be honest, my English skills could use some improvement. In the past, my fear
of communicating in English prevented me from taking an active part in negotiations.
However, I'm working on it now. I've been doing an online English course for a few
months and it looks like I'm getting over my fear.

Could you tell us about your education and working experience?

I am a web developer with a bachelor's degree in computer science and over 5 years
of experience. In my most recent job, I was involved in creating and modifying
websites. I was responsible for designing the user interface of web applications.

Why are you leaving your current job?

Well, I must say thank you to my previous employer for giving me the opportunity
to learn and grow professionally. But I feel like I'm not fully satisfied with
the work I'm doing. I would love to do something more challenging.

to repeat it. For example, you can say:

Sorry, I didn't quite get it. Could you please say that again?
I'm sorry, I didn't hear the last part. Can you repeat it, please?
